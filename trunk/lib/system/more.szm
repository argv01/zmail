# Mail routing and address-fixing conveniences.  If auto_route is set, then
# replies to messages take a closer look at the addresses of the recipients.
# If any redundant paths are present, they are pruned.  Also, the path that
# precedes any hosts listed in the "known_hosts" list is truncated.  This is
# useful for uucp sites only, and is therefore commented out by default.
