This subdirectory (/z-code/zm/lib/attach) contains assorted pieces of
attachment type files and a script called "buildat" that glues them all
together into the attach.types file for a given port.  Any new types that
should be added to the distribution should go into files in the attach
subdirectory.  If you add a file, add the appropriate reference to it to
the buildat script.

If one of your changes is specific to a platform, it should go in a file
"attach.platform" (e.g. "attach.sun" or "attach.sgi").  If it is an audio
type, the file should be "audio.platform"; similarly for video, once we
have some of those (DECstation?) ...  If you invent a new zmail builtin
command, then use "description.zm" as the filename (e.g. "audio.zm" is
for the "sound" command).

Insert references to generic (any platform) attachment type files into
buildat in the "generic" section at the beginning; platform-specific stuff
goes in the "case" statement at the end (add a new case if you're adding
something for a platform that isn't there yet).
