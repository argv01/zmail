"New Mail Check" Scenario

Add a new system scenario called "New Mail Check" that 
consists of the following settings:

Common Messages:
  For messages that are on both the PC and 
the host:
	p do not propagate changes

Host-only Messages:
  For messages that are on the host but 
are not on the PC:
  Messages marked read:
	p Ignore
  Unread messages:
	p Copy from host to PC

PC-only messages:
  For messages that are on the PC but not 
on the host:
  Messages marked read:
	p Ignore
  Unread messages:
	p Ignore

Deleted Messages:
  For messages that are on the host but 
have been deleted from the PC:
	p Leave on the host

Preview
  When synchronizing with this scenario:
	p Never Preview

This scenario's Description should explain how and when 
this scenario is used.


System Scenario vs. User Scenario

	System scenarios cannot be edited.  This is a major 
drawback, since some users will want to change the 
default new mail sync behavior.  However, system 
scenarios also can't be deleted, which is a major bonus.  
Given this choice, it is probably better to provide the 
new mail check scenario as a system scenario.  Opinions?
