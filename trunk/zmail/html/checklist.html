<P>
The following is a summary of the clone and build process. 
<BR>
<BR>Note: You should be cloning work trees underneath your home directory in /projects/zmail/users,
or /projects/zmail/work. 
<P>
The first several steps are done only once, and only if you are cloning a new tree.
<PRE>
$ cd /projects/zmail/users/your-name-here
$ mkdir osname-host
</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(examples of osname-host are hp800_10-avon and aix4-zeugma. By 
convention this is how we name public build trees)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
<BR>
Note, do the following steps on zyrcon!! If you aren't there now, rlogin or 
telnet in before continuing.
<BR>
$ cd osname-host
$ cvs co -r motif-4-1-branch zmail 
$ cvs co metamail-dist 
$ cvs co mp 
$ cvs co imap 
$ cvs co ldap 
$ cd zmail
$ setenv DOCDIR /hosts/zyrcon/usr1/build/DocRep
$ sh doc.sh 
</PRE>
Now, go to the host you are doing the build on, and cd to the zmail directory 
of the clone tree before continuing. The remainder of the steps must happen 
on the build host
<PRE>
$ sh configure osname
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(for example, $ sh configure hp800_10)
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</PRE>
If you are making a distribution, you must also configure mp and metamail: 
<PRE>
<LI>cd ../mp 
<LI>sh configure 
<LI>cd ../metamail 
</PRE>
Click <A HREF="metamail.html">here</A> for the explicit steps required to
obtain a makefile for the OS for which you are doing a build. Note that 
some hosts require modification in order for mp to build, so check this
page carefully
<PRE>
<LI>make 
<LI>cd ../zmail 
</PRE>
 </P>
The remainder of the steps actually generate the binaries and build the
distributions, and may be done more than once (for example, to generate
a new release after a checkin has been made and cvs update has been run). 
 <P>
If not in the zmail directory:
<PRE>
$ cd /projects/zmail/revbuilds/osname-host/zmail
</PRE>
 <P>
Then, generate makefiles and build the small version:
<PRE>
$ sh mkmakes osname small zpop
$ make
</PRE>
Next, do a make clean, and generate makefiles and build the motif version:
<PRE>
$ make clean
$ sh mkmakes osname motif zpop
$ make
<PRE>
<BR>
Note:
<BR>
If you are building the motif version on one of the following hosts:
<BR>
<LI>sun411
<LI>sun413
<LI>sun414
<LI>sol23
<LI>sol24
<LI>sol25cc
<LI>m88k4
<P>
</PRE>
then you must do the following instead of make:
<PRE>
$ make zmail.static zmail.shared; cp zmail.static zmail
<BR>
</PRE>
After doing the make (or make zmail.static zmail.shared; cp zmail.static zmail), 
then it is time to build a distribution:
<PRE>
$ make DISTROOT=.. distribution 
</PRE>
Then, it is time to build lite and do its distribution:
<BR>
<BR>
First - if you did a make zmail.static zmail.shared above, then you must 
remove them so that they are not copied with the lite distribution:
<PRE>
$ rm zmail.static zmail.shared

Then:

$ make clean
$ sh mkmakes osname lite zpop
$ make
</PRE>
 <P>
If you need to build a zpop server for inclusion in the distribution:
<PRE>
     $ cd zync
     $ sh configure --target=osname          (note the --)
</PRE>
Click <A HREF="zyncnotes.html">here</A> for changes you may need to make
to the generated makefile before doing the make, then:
<PRE>
     $ make
     $ make dist
     $ cd ..

$ make DISTROOT=.. distribution
</PRE>
