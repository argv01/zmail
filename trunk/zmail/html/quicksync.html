"Sync should be easier!" - the masses
"All right, all right!" - the sync folks


New File Menu item:
     QuickSync -> Check In
                  Check Out 


Description:
"QuickSync" is a hierarchical/pull-right/cascading menu item containing
the items "Check In" and "Check Out".  The "QuickSync" item should be
placed just below the "Synchronize Mailbox..." menu item.

The "Check In" menu item will call a z-script that starts a sync
scenario called "QuickSync Check In".  The "Check Out" menu item will
call a z-script that starts a sync scenario called "QuickSync Check
Out".

Menu Sensitivity:
The "QuickSync" menu item and its contents should be gray but visible
whenever the current, active folder is not the main spool.  It is
potentially misleading to allow people to choose this item while they
are looking at some other folder.


New User Scenarios:
  QuickSync Check In
  QuickSync Check Out


Description:
These are the scenarios used by the "Check In" and "Check Out" sub-
menus.

To start with, let's make "QuickSync Check In" the same as "Check in
from PC" and "QuickSync Check Out" the same as "Check out to PC
(regular use)".

The one exception is that these two scenarios will be set to "Never
Preview".  To quote Steve, "By God, it's going to be simple."

RQ and Robert are currently working on the settings for these
scenarios.  When they are done, we should get feedback from people far
and wide.

Note these are user level scenarios, so users can go change them to
their hearts' content.
