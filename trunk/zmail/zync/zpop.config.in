# The TRACE directive specifies where to log errors and debugging messages (if
# any).  If a trace file is not specified, any error or debugging messages that
# are generated will be reported via the syslog() facility.

# The DEBUG directive specifies which debugging and warning messages should be
# reported.  zpop will always report serious errors, regardless of the value of
# this directive.  By default, zpop will also generate warnings for situations
# which are not fatal, but probably require attention.  Please see the
# CONFIG.TXT file for more information on possible values of this directive.
