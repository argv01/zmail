# .mushrc to cause Mush to emulate UCB Mail
# -- Bart Schaefer (schaefer@cse.ogi.edu)
#
# This file can be used as either the DEFAULT_RC or the ALT_DEF_RC (see
#  config.h) but such use is NOT recommended.  Instead, you should modify
#  one of those files to "source" this file.
#
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Shortcomings:
#  Mush does not support the "noisy phone line" flags of Mail
#   (-i command line option or "set ignore" to ignore RUBOUT characters)
#  Mush will never remove a system mailbox (no "unset keep" equivalent)
#  See comments below on (lack of) command prefix recognition
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Set up prompting, headers
#
set prompt='& '
set mil_time date_received
set hdr_format='%8.80a %D %M %-2N %5T  %l/%c "%.29s"'
#
# Set up mailing/replying miscellaneous
#
set indent_str = "	"
set reply_to_hdr auto_route
#
# Set up command interface
#  Note that a full emulation is difficult, because Mush does not support
#  command prefix recognition (e.g., Mail interprets "Rep" as "Reply").
#
# Don't barf if history doesn't work, but still do cmd expansion
#
set nonobang
#
# This stuff is fine, but really needs prefix recognition.
