This is release 7.2.0 of the SunView implementation of mush.

Version 7.2.0 differs from 7.1.2 in additions to general functionality
and in bug fixes.  There are no significant changes to the appearance
of any of the interfaces.  The changes to add certain enhancements were
significant enough that the revision number was increased from 1 to 2.

New/changed commands:

    about
	This command produces an informational message about the program
	and its authors.  It is available as a help menu selection in
	tool mode.

    alts user@host
	This new alternates syntax is provided to make the behavior a
	little more intuitive.  It is equivalent to
	    alts !host!user
	and will be displayed in that form in the alternates list or
	in "saveopts" option dumps.

    headers -H:m
	The :m modifier (which can be used as a standalone command, as
	with other such modifiers) selects messages having a temporary
	mark.  See below.

    mark
    mark -[priority]
    unmark
	The "mark" command sets user-defined flag bits on messages.
	With no arguments (or only a message list), it attaches a
	temporary mark, not saved across updates.  With a -priority
	argument, where priority is a letter A through E, a permanent
	priority is assigned.  Priorities are removed by "mark -".
	Temporary marks are removed by "unmark".

	For the curses interface, the `*' key is now bound by default
	to the new curses-command "mark".  This command toggles the
	temporary mark on the current message.

    pick -p priority
	The -p option selects messages with priority specified by an
	integer A through E.  Multiple -p options may be used, e.g.
	    pick -p B -p D
	will select messages having either priority B or priority D.

	An additional change to the pick command is that some option
	or pattern must be specified.  Using "pick" with no arguments
	to repeat the last pattern search is no longer supported.  It
	was never supported completely (only the pattern was retained,
	not other information about where to look for it) and has been
	eliminated to prevent confusion.

    sort -p
	The -p option orders messages by priority, A first, E last.
	Marked messages (having the temporary mark) are treated as
	highest priority for purposes of this ordering.  The ordering
	can be reversed by using "sort -rp".  Also, the default status
	sort now uses priority when status is otherwise the same.

New/changed variables:

    $cdpath
	It is no longer necessary to include "." in $cdpath.

    $prompt
	The values of variables can now be included in the prompt at
	the time it is displayed.  The format syntax "%$variable",
	where "variable" is some variable name, will insert the value
	into the prompt.  Remember to use single quotes when setting
	prompt strings to protect such variable references.

Details of general changes:

    * The "preserve" command is now closer in behavior to UCB Mail and
      Sun Mailtool, and mush now properly retains preserved status set
      by either of those mailers.  Preserving a message no longer causes
      it to be marked "U" (unread) when the folder is reloaded.

    * In addition to the usual set of status bits, six user-defined bits
      have been added.  The first is a `mark' bit, which shows up as a
      `+' following the message number in the header display.  This bit
      is not retained across folder update.  The other five bits are
      `priority' bits A through E, displayed in the same spot if the mark
      is not present.  These bits are retained across update in a Priority:
      header placed just above the Status: header.  Priorities can be used
      to select messages by using the "pick -p" command.  Marked messages
      can be selected by the ":m" command.  The "sort -p" command orders
      messages by priority (A highest, E lowest).  Marks and priorities
      are attached to messages via the "mark" command.

    * The "update" command now retains the "N" (new) status of messages
      across the write-back to the folder.  The "quit" command still
      changes the status to "U" (unread) on write-back, but new status
      can be retained even across exit/restart by using "update;quit"
      to exit from mush.

    * Systems in European time zones using the /etc/timezone database
      report daylight savings time in a two-word format, e.g. "MET DST".
      The date parser has been fixed to recognize those formats in both
      RFC822-compatible and ctime(3)-compatible date lines.  If you find
      that you receive two-word time zones in one of the more exotic
      date line styles that mush attempts to recognize, you'll have to
      fix dates.c yourself.

    * The cmd_help file now contains an entry with information of general
      interest about the program and its authors.  This information is
      accessed via a new command, "about", or via "help about".

Bugs fixed:

    * The header display for mixed-format addresses now works as it has
      been advertised to work since 7.1.2.
    * Lock files are now properly removed for DOT_LOCK systems.
    * History keyword searches now work properly for SysV systems.
    * User-supplied From: lines for outgoing mail (via "my_hdr From:") 
      are now properly inserted regardless of the value of $edit_hdrs.
    * When composing mail, the escape character (normally tilde, `~')
      is not treated as an escape if line wrap ($wrapcolumn) causes it
      to become the first character on a line.
    * If the .signature file does not have a terminating newline, mush
      will provide one.
    * Sending mail from the tool no longer leaves <defunct> processes
      to accumulate in the process table.
    * When changing directories, the current directories is always
      searched first; "." in $cdpath is ignored.
    * MIPS and other BSD-SYSV hybrid systems that use the getwd() call
      instead of the usual SysV getcwd() can define GETWD in config.h
      to select the correct call.

Tool mode changes:

    * The new mail flag in the mush mailbox icon now goes up whenever
      new mail arrives in the spool mailbox, even if the current folder
      is not the spool mailbox.  Also, if the current folder is not the
      spool but the size of the spool shrinks -- that is, the spool is
      updated from another mush or mail session -- the flag will go up
      to notify the user that "someone else" has modified his spool.

    * When mushtool is started up or changed to a new folder, the first
      new/unread message in the folder is automatically displayed.  In
      previous versions, this would cause the message to be marked as
      read, so that message would be saved to the user's mbox on the
      next update, even if that message had previously been "preserved"
      for storage in the spool file.  In 7.2, the message is still
      displayed, but its preserved status is not changed unless it is
      explicitly read by the user at a later time.

    * There is a new panel button in the header panel to toggle marks
      and set priorities.

===========================================================================

Information on the compose frame when the variable "compose_icon"
is set.

The compose frame is created as its own base frame, rather than a
child frame of the tool frame. The advantage of this is that the
compose window can be closed to an icon, rather than closed to
invisibleness.

The compose frame is opened by clicking on the "Compose" or "Reply"
buttons in the main mushtool panel or by clicking on or opening the
compose window icon (if it is visible). The very first the time
compose window is opened it must be done with the Compose or Reply
buttons in order to create the frame.

The compose frame can be closed by using the SunView frame popup
menu or by clicking on the "Close" button in the compose frame
panel.  It may be destroyed by choosing "Quit Compose Frame" from
the "Close" button menu or the "Quit" selection from the SunView
frame popup menu.

Repeated sequences of creating and destroying compose frames will
use up file descriptors in Sun OS 3.5, due to a bug where a destroyed
ttysw does not free up its fd's.  This appears to have been fixed
in later versions of SunOS.

The compose frame icon may be changed via the options menu and
mushrc files in the same manner that the tool icons are changable.

Closing the base tool with the "Done" button will also close the
compose frame (if it is open). The compose frame may be opened by
itself if all the user needs to do is compose/send a message.
Quiting mushtool also destroys the compose frame.

The default compose icon is the "textedit" icon with a label of
"mush" added to it.  To use your own custom icon, set "compose_icon"
to the path of the icon file.
