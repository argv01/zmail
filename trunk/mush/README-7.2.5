This is release 7.2.5 of the Mail User's Shell (mush).

Mush was last posted as a complete package at release 7.2.2.  Before that,
the last complete posting was 7.1.1.  If your version of mush is older
than 7.2.2, refer to README-7.0 and README-7.1 for lists of other changes.
See README-7.2.0 for changes from 7.1.1 to 7.2.  Patch 3 was bugfixes only;
there was no README-7.2.3.  See README-7.2.4 for a list of changes in both
patch 3 and patch 4.

Changes in compilation:

    POP3_SUPPORT
	Enable POP client mode by compiling with this defined.  See README.

    New files to support POP and DOT_LOCK have been added to the makefiles.

New/changed commands:

    See the $metamail variable for changes in print/type/etc.

New/changed variables:

    metamail
	If $metamail is set to the pathname (and arguments) of a MIME
	decoder (such as the "metamail" program), Mush will recognize
	MIME messages and "page" them through that decoder instead of
	through the regular $pager.

Tool mode changes:

    Bug fixes only, see below.

Bugs fixed in Patch #5:

  * Better parsing of double-quoted tokens in addresses

  * Unsetenv allocates a new copy of the environment on first call

  * Doesn't attempt to init tty if there isn't one

  * #define CURSES in config.h (as opposed to in CFLAGS) should work

  * On AIX, curses mode won't dump core

  * Recognize more date formats, and store dates to resolution in seconds
    for more accurate date sorting

  * Tool mode "sort" menu "by value of sort variable" works now

  * Better handling of X.400 addresses (heuristic for distinguishing them
    from file names has been improved)

  * Tool mode "save" pullright directory-walking menus work in all contexts
    (I hope)

  * Moved that silly piece of code that was setting $realname to the
    spool folder path

  * Code to init all hostname aliases for $hostname finally works right in
    all cases

  * Many improvements to DOT_LOCK; NFS "secure" lockfile creation

  * ~user/$variable parses correctly and expands $variable

  * Some compilation fixes for SGI IRIX

  * Child-process management for pager process improved

  * Support for POSIX_UTIME fixed

  * "saveopts" of variables, aliases, etc. with embedded quotes of mixed
    types does appropriate quoting of its output
