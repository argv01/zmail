<P>In
fact, the <CODE>SUPERCLASS</CODE> macro inserts an entire instance of the
superclass, which in turn contains an instance of <EM>its</EM> superclass,
and so on.  In this way, a pointer to a <CODE>struct <VAR>foo</VAR></CODE> can
be cast to a pointer to a <CODE>struct <VAR>bar</VAR></CODE> and a valid
<CODE>struct <VAR>bar</VAR></CODE> will be found at that address!
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="spoor.html#FOOT2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>An
<STRONG>lvalue</STRONG> is something that can be on the left-hand side of an
assignment operator.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="spoor.html#FOOT3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>The <VAR>name</VAR> and
<VAR>doc</VAR> parameters are included on the off chance that someday,
someone will want a SPOOR class browser.  They also aid in
debugging.
