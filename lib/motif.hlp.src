%General%

           Welcome to Z-Mail 5.0!
  
With Z-Mail, you can read and reply to your incoming mail, send new
messages, save messages, print messages, search, and do many more
mail-related functions.  Most anything that you might wish to do with
electronic mail messages can be done with Z-Mail in one way or
another.  
  
@@ifdef ZMAIL_BASIC
Many of the common tasks can be found in the ~#Main Window#~'s
menubar, where pulldown menus provide access to most Z-Mail
functions.  There is also the ~#Button panel#~ containing 
pushbuttons that are equivalent to many common menu items.

%Help%
Help is available in most parts of the application.  Most dialogs have
a Help button in the lower right corner or a Help menu on the right
side of the menubar, if one exists.  Help information guides you
through common tasks, and shows correct usage for commands and
techniques for interacting with Z-Mail dialogs.

The "Click for Help" Help menu item changes to pointer to a hand.  When
the pointer is a hand, move the pointer to the area for which you need
help and click the left mouse button.  The ~#Help Index#~ dialog will
appear, displaying help information for the item you clicked.

@@ifndef ZMAIL_BASIC
Help for Z-Script commands is accessed either by typing "help <command>"
or "? <command>" in the Command Area of the main Z-Mail Window
(replace <command> with the command name on which you want help).

The "?" command lists all the Z-Script commands.

Click a topic in the left hand list of the Help Index dialog to see
help in the text field to the right.

Words that are underlined have corresponding entries elsewhere in the
help text.  If you double-click on underlined words, you'll be taken
to the corresponding ~#help#~ entry.  For example, if you double-click on
the following word:

       ~#Attachments~ui#~
 
then you'll jump to the ~#help#~ entry describing Z-Mail attachments.

You may also type a phrase into the "Search For" text field and click the
Search button to search the entire help text for the phrase.
Subsequent clicks of the Search button will find subsequent
occurrences of the phrase.

working copy.

If you lack permissions to modify the folder, Z-Mail will
automatically mark the folder read-only, even if the "Read Only"
radio button is not selected.

To see only files that are mail folders, set the "Folders Only"
toggle. To see files with names that begin with ".",
set the "Hidden Files" toggle.
%%

%Removing Folders%
To remove a folder:

The New... item brings up a ~#File Finder#~. 
In the File box, specify the name of the folder you
want to create.  If you specify the name of a folder
that already exists, a dialog will pop up asking if
you want to empty the existing folder.

If you have selected a directory in the file list, 
click "Search" to show its contents.

You can also create a folder by saving a message to it.  In this
case, you are not asked to confirm creation of the folder.
%%

%Folders%
A folder is a file that contains a number of messages.  Your Mailbox
is a folder where your mail is delivered. See below for instructions on
creating new folders.

See ~#Saving Messages#~ for information about saving messages to
folders.

If you manage large amounts of mail, you'll probably want to group
your mail into a number of folders, each one holding related messages
on a particular topic.

To create a new folder, save a
message into a folder name which is
not already in use, or choose
"New..." from the Folder menu of the
Main Screen.

You may open a new folder by choosing
"Open..." from the Folder menu in the
~#Main Screen#~.  You must open a
folder in order to view or manipulate
the messages in it.  The folder name
may start with a tilde (~/reports,
for example) indicating that it
resides in your home directory; or it
may start with a plus sign (+) to
indicate your folder directory
(+reports, for example).  Your folder
directory is specified by the
~#folder~var#~ variable.  Note that a
slash (/) must appear between the
tilde (~) and the file name when
referring to your home directory.
However, the slash is optional when
using plus (+) to refer to the
~#folder~var#~ directory.  

You may rename an existing folder by 
choosing "Rename..." from the Folder menu in the
~#Main Screen#~.  Selecting this item will cause
a dialog to be displayed which allows you to select 
an old folder and specify the name of the new folder.
The naming conventions for the new folder are the 
same as those described for the "Open..." menu item, 
above.

You may remove an existing folder by choosing
"Remove..." from the Folder menu in the
~#Main Screen#~.  You will be prompted for
the name of the folder to remove.

To update the contents of the currently open folder,
choose "Update" from the Folder menu in the
~#Main Screen#~.

To close the currently open folder, choose "Close 
Folder" from the Folder menu in the
~#Main Screen#~.

If you're using the Z-POP program to deliver your mail, this Z-Mail for 
Motif version now supports mailbox and local folder synchronization. 
This feature is available by choosing the "Synchronize" menu item 
from the Folder menu in the ~#Main Screen#~.

Synchronization offers three scenarios for synchronizing your 
mailboxes:

- Quick Check Out

- Quick Check In

- Check New Mail

In addition, you can synchronize two open mail folders.

Configuring for synchronization

To enable Z-Mail synchronization capabilities, you must first set the 
following Z-Script variables:

set mailhost=hostname

set use_pop

set pop_options=use_sync

You can also set these variables through the Z-Mail Variables dialog.

After you set the mailhost, use_pop, and pop_options variables, save 
your changes to your.zmailrc file.

Synchronizing mailboxes

To synchronize your mailboxes, from the Main window:

1.	Pull down the Folder menu and select Synchronize.

2.	Select one of the following synchronization scenarios:

To check the current state of your mailbox when you start a 
Z-Mail session, select Quick Check Out.

To check the current state of your mailbox when you're 
finishing a Z-Mail session, select Quick Check In.

To check your mailbox for new mail during a Z-Mail session, 
select Check New Mail.

Synchronizing mail folders

To synchronize mail folders, open only the two mail folders you want 
to synchronize. All other mail folders must be closed.

From the Main window, follow these steps:

1.	Pull down the Folder menu and select Synchronize.

2.	Select Folders. 

This synchronizes all open mail folders. For additional information, 
refer to the Z-Script zpop_sync command.
%%

%Folder Status List%
%Folder_Status_List%
The Folder Status List is located near the top of the ~#Main Window#~,
just below the Toolbar (if you have the Toobar enabled).

To enable the Folder Status List, select Folder Status from 
Layout menu, which is located on the ~#Menu Bar#~.

The Folder Status List displays information about your mailbox.
The information that is displayed is governed by the setting of
the folder_title variable. Set the folder_title variable use
the ~#Variables Dialog#~.

%%

%Forwarding Messages%
%Forwarding_a_Message%

You can forward a message when viewing its
message summary in the Main Window or right
after reading it in the Message Display Window.
In the Main Window,

 - Select it from the Message Summaries list.
 
 - Choose Forward from the Compose menu, or
   click on the Forward button.

The Forward command in the Compose menu opens a
pullright menu.  Choose Resend to send the
message unedited. The Resend dialog opens. Fill
in the address(es) of the intended recipient(s)
and click on the OK button.

Choose Edited to edit or add your comments to
the message. A Compose Window opens that
includes a copy of the original message in the
body of the forward message. The subject of the
original message is added to the subject field
of the forward message, prepended with
"(Fwd)". Edit the message, fill in the
recipient's address, and click on the Send
button.

Choose As Attachments to forward the message as
an attachment of a new message. A Compose
Window opens that includes a copy of the
original message in the Attachments area. The
subject of the original message is added to the
subject field of the forward message, prepended
with "(Fwd)." Write a message, fill in the
recipient's address, and click on the Send
button.

You can forward a message immediately after
reading it, as you go through your new mail. In
the Message Display Window, Click on the
Forward button. A Compose Window opens that
includes a copy of the original message in the
body of the forward message. The subject of the
original message is added to the subject field
of the forward message, prepended with "(Fwd)".
Edit the message, if desired, fill in the
recipient's address, then click on the Send
button.

%%
%Printing Messages%
There are three ways to print a message:
  
  - In the ~#Main Window#~, select the messages
    you wish to print and click the Print button 
    or choose Print from the right-button pop-up 
    menu.  The selected messages will be printed 
    on the default printer, which you specify 
    using the ~#printer~var#~ variable.
  
  - In the ~#Main Window#~, select the message(s) 
    you wish to print from the ~#Message Summaries#~, 
    and click and select "Print" from the Message 
    menu.  

  - On the ~#Message Display Window#~, select 
    "Print" from the Message menu to print the 
    message you're viewing.

The second and third methods cause the Print dialog to appear.
%%<Print Dialog
%%

%Print Dialog%
%printer_dialog%
In the Print dialog, you can adjust:

  - Which messages are printed by
    changing the ~#message list#~ in the
    Messages field.

  - Which ~#headers#~, if any, are printed along 
    with the message by setting one of the 
    Print Message: toggles.

  - Which printer to print on, by selecting
    a printer from the Printers list.

Click the "Print" button to send the message to the printer.

By default, the entire message (except for attachments, see below)
including the ~#headers#~ is sent to the printer.  If you have
explicitly "ignored" headers in the ~#Headers#~ dialog, then those
headers are omitted from the printed message.  If you have explicitly
set headers to "Show Only" in the Headers dialog, then only those
headers are printed with the message.

The setting of "Show Only" in the headers dialog overrides the setting
of "Ignored Headers" when you print messages.

Most message attachments are not printed.  Short, plain-text
attachments that are not encoded will be printed, as will any
RFC822 attachment, regardless of encoding. Other attachments will only
be summarized.  The text printed is the same as that which
appears in the Message Display Window. 

The list of printers is taken from the value of the variable
~#printer~var#~.  If the printer name begins with a hyphen (-), it is
treated as an option that should be passed to the command that does
the actual printing.

At the bottom of the dialog is the "Print Command" type-in field.
When the default printing command (lpr or lp) is to be used, this
field is labeled "Printer Name:".  If a special printing command has
been specified by setting the variable ~#print_cmd~var#~, then that
command is displayed and the type-in field is labeled "Print
Command:".  See the ~#printer~var#~ and ~#print_cmd~var#~ variables
for details.  You may edit this field, but you should do so only if
you are sure you know what you are doing, lest you make printing stop
working!
%%

%Save Dialog%
%save_dialog%
The Save dialog is used for saving messages to folders.
%%<Saving Messages
%%

%Saving Messages%
"Saving" a message means copying it into a folder.  If the folder into
which you are saving the message(s) does not exist, it will be created
for you.

You can save the currently selected message(s) by:

  - Choosing the "Save..." item from the Message menu of
    the Main or ~#Message Display Window#~.

  - Clicking the "Save" button on the Main or
    ~#Message Display Window#~s.

  - Choosing the "Save" item from the right-button popup
    menu in the ~#Message Summaries#~ list in the ~#Main Window#~. 

All of these bring up the Save dialog, where you specify the folder in
which to save the message(s).  The Save dialog is a ~#File Finder#~.
In the Save dialog, you can:

  - Change which messages you wish to save
    by editing the Messages: field.

  - Tell Z-Mail save only the text parts of the
    message body by setting the "Save Text
    Only" toggle.  Don't use this option
    if you're saving into a folder!

  - The "Prune Large Parts" toggle removes large attachments 
     from the message before saving.  Attachments larger than 
     the given cutoff size, in bytes, will be removed from the 
     saved message. See also the variable ~#attach_prune_size~var#~, 
     which sets the cutoff when the Save dialog is used.

Click "Save" to save the messages.  Click "Search" to scan the
selected directory.  Click "Cancel" to abort the operation.  You can
also double-click on a file name to save to that file, or double-click
on a directory name to search that directory.

When you save a message, Z-Mail marks it as saved (S) in the
~#Message Summaries#~.

To save a message you are currently composing, please refer to ~#Composing Messages#~.
%%<-shared-saving-messages
%%

%-shared-saving-messages%
You may save messages to your main mailbox or to any other folder.  A
folder is a file containing one or more messages and their headers.
The location of your main mailbox is specified by the ~#mbox~var#~
variable; by default, it is "~/mbox".  If you regularly Save large amounts of
mail, you can organize your mail by saving related messages to
appropriate folders.  New mail is delivered to your system folder, so
you don't normally save messages to that folder.

If the file does not exist, it is created.  If the file exists, the
message is appended to it.  To overwrite the current contents of the
folder instead of appending, turn on the "Overwrite File" toggle.
This toggle is automatically turned off after each save operation to
prevent accidental overwrite.

To save the body of a message only, to a plain file (rather than to
a folder), turn on the "Save Text Only" toggle before clicking "Save".
This toggle is also reset after each save operation.  If you attempt
to save text only to a file that is a folder, a Warning popup appears
to confirm the action.  Similarly, if you save a message with headers
to a file that is not a folder, you are asked for confirmation.

You can specify a range, or group of messages to save by typing a
range in the "Messages" type-in field.

Usually when messages are saved, Z-Mail marks them as saved in the
~#Message Summaries#~ and deletes them in the next update.  If you don't
want to have saved messages deleted, you must undelete them or set the
variable ~#keepsave~var#~.
%%

%Fonts Dialog%
%Fonts Dialog%
%fonts_dialog%
The Fonts dialog allows you to interactively change the fonts and
labels of some objects on the screen.  You may change the font
for entire "classes" of objects, such as all the push buttons.  
You may also change individual objects separately; for example,
you may change the font of only the Read button in the Main Window.
You may also use this dialog to change the text (or label) on
a particular interface item such as a menu or button.

The scrolling area at the top of the window lists all the 
currently available fonts.  The Font(s): field displays the
font currently selected in the scrolling area.  You may type
a font name in this field directly if you prefer. The scrolling
area in the center of the window displays sample text in the
currently selected font.

Use the toggles in the Set Mode: area to specify the type
of action you want to perform.

        - Fonts: Interactive is used to assign fonts to 
          specific interface objects, such as a single push button.

        - Fonts: Object Type is used to assign fonts to entire
          classes of objects, such as all push buttons or all
          menus.

        - Label Only is used to change only the text on a
          specific interface object.  For example, you can change
          the label on the Read button in the Main Window to
          "Display" instead.

        - Label and Font is used to both change the text on a
          specific interface object and to assign a new font.

If you're assigning fonts to entire classes of objects, use the
Objects: toggle buttons to specify the items to which the new
font should be applied. 

Once you've selected a font and specified a mode, click Assign.
If you're using any mode except for Object Type, the cursor 
changes to a pencil.  Click on an interface object to change
it according to the mode you're using.

If you're using Label Only or Label and Font mode, an
Input dialog appears containing the current name of the
object.  Enter a new label in the dialog and click OK.

You may click on as many objects as you wish.  When you are 
finished, click on any part of the screen NOT ASSOCIATED WITH 
Z-MAIL and the cursor will return to normal.

If you like what you've chosen, click the "Save" button.

The file from which Z-Mail retrieves settings of fonts and labels saved
in this dialog is identified by the value of the variable ~#fonts_db~var#~.
If ~#fonts_db~var#~ is not set, the default fonts file is .zmfonts in your
home directory.  When you click "Save", an Input popup displays the
current value of ~#fonts_db~var#~ and asks you whether to save the fonts and
labels there.  You may edit the file name in the Input popup to save
fonts to another file.

If you save settings to a file other than that first shown, you must
change the value of ~#fonts_db~var#~ in order for Z-Mail to use the fonts.
This value can be changed in the Variables dialog.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the X system, you cannot reset your
fonts and labels back to their original settings.  If you wish to
revert to the original fonts and labels, you must remove the fonts file
and restart Z-Mail.  
%%

%Colors Dialog%
%color_dialog%
The Colors Dialog dialog allows you to interactively change the
colors of some objects on the screen.  You may change entire "classes"
of objects, such as PushButtons or Menus.

Most objects have a "background" and "foreground" color.  Changing the
foreground color of an object affects the object's primary features,
such as the label on a button.  Changing the background affects
everything that's not the foreground, such as the rectangle behind the
label on a button.  

To select a foreground color, click the Foreground toggle and then click
on any color tile.  The foreground of the sample pushbutton will
reflect your choice.  To set the background color, click the Background 
toggle and click on any other color tile.  (You may set both the foreground
and background to the same color, but this will make the objects very
difficult to use.)

Once you've chosen a color scheme, select the types of objects to which
you'd like it applied.  Click Assign to have the new colors appear.

If you like what you've chosen, click the "Save" button.

The file from which Z-Mail retrieves settings from colors saved in this
dialog is identified by the value of the variable ~#colors_db~var#~.  If
~#colors_db~var#~ is not set, the default colors file is .zmcolors in your
home directory.  When you click "Save", an Input popup displays the
current value of ~#colors_db~var#~ and asks you whether to save the colors
there.  You may edit the file name in the Input popup to save colors
to another file.

If you save settings to a file other than that first shown, you must
change the value of ~#colors_db~var#~ in order for Z-Mail to use the colors.
This value can be changed in the Variables dialog.

Unfortunately, due to the nature of the X system, you cannot reset your
colors back to their original settings.  If you wish to revert to the
original colors, you must remove your colors file and restart Z-Mail.
%%

%Updating%
%update%
When you update a folder, the changes that you've made to the folder
since the last update are made permanent.  Deleted mail is permanently
purged from the folder and cannot be retrieved after an update.

You can only update the active folder.  To update the active folder,
you can:

  - Choose the Update item from the
    Folder menu on the ~#Main Window#~.

  - Click the Update button on the 
    ~#Main Window#~.

If new mail has arrived in the folder, Z-Mail will incorporate it
before updating.
%%

%Unpreserve%
%%<Preserve
%%

%Preserve%
After you read mail and you "update" or quit Z-Mail, unread messages
are copied back into your system mailbox and deleted messages are
removed.  Messages which have been read but not deleted may either be
held in the system mailbox or saved in your main mailbox file.

The location of your main mailbox is determined by the value of the
~#mbox~var#~ variable and is "~/mbox" by default.  This file is referred to
as the mbox file.

The variable ~#hold~var#~ determines whether messages remain in the system
mailbox or are saved to your mbox.  Normally messages are held, but
your system administrator may have configured Z-Mail to save them.

You can mark specific messages to be held in your system mailbox by
preserving" them with the Preserve menu item.  Preserved messages are
always held, even when Z-Mail has been configured to save other
messages in the mbox.

To preserve a message, select Preserve either from the Main Window
Message menu or from the right-button popup in the Message Summaries
area.  To remove the preserved mark from a message, the Unpreserve
item is used.

%Delete%
The Delete item of the Main Window Message menu marks as deleted all
messages whose numbers appear in the Messages: field.  Unless you have
edited the Messages: field, the numbers there are those of the selected
messages in the Message Summaries list.

In the Message Display Window, the "Delete" button marks as deleted the
message that is displayed.  The Delete item from the Message menu marks as
deleted all messages whose numbers are shown in the Messages: field.
Unless you have edited the Messages: field, the number there is the
same as that of the displayed message.
%%<-shared-delete

%-shared-delete%
Selecting "Delete" may also take you to the next message in the
folder, except that the current message is deleted before advancing.
The variable ~#autoprint~var#~ must be set in order for "Delete" to
advance automatically to the next message.  It is advisable to delete
unimportant mail after reading it, as it conserves system resources
and improves the efficiency of Z-Mail.

Aliases allow you to mail to users with long addresses using short
names. For example, if you often send messages to:

    fred@fjones.com

but don't want to type this long address every time you send a
message, you may make an alias for that address.

In the Mail Aliases dialog, select the "Alias Name:" text entry field
and enter a shorter but equally meaningful name, such as:

    fred

then select the "Alias Address(es):" field and type:

    fred@fjones.com

Finally, click on the Apply button to add the new alias to the alias
list.  Now, whenever you specify

   fred

as the recipient of a message, it will be sent to fred@fjones.com.

See the Help Index entry for ~#Address Forms#~ for more details on address
formats and syntax.

If you frequently mail to a group of people, you may create an alias to
stand for the entire group.  Choose an alias name as usual and simply
place all the recipients in the "Alias Address(es):" field:

    Alias Name:  project-group
 
    Alias Address(es):  fred mary bob@jay.eng sly@baz.bitnet
 
To remove one or more aliases, select them from the list and click

hit apply. Use the button located above the scrolled list to 
select the category of variables displayed.

The Search For: field may be used to search through all the
variable descriptions for a particular word or phrase.

The area below the Search For: field is used to change the state of
the currently selected variable. The contents of this area varies,
depending on the selected variable.  For some variables, only toggles
labeled "Set" and "Unset" appear.  For others, text fields,
additional toggle boxes, or numeric sliders appear.  The text 
in the Variable Description field explains the purpose of each 
toggle or text field.

When entering text in a text field, click on the text entry field
before beginning to type.  The value of the variable will only be
changed when the Return key is pressed.

The value of a numeric variable is set by dragging the sliding bar
in the scale until the desired value is shown.  No other action is
necessary to set the value of a numeric variable.

The buttons at the bottom of the dialog affect all the variables, not
just the variable that is currently displayed.  The "Save" button will
write the current state of Z-Mail to a file, including the values of
all variables, and the "Load" button will read values from a file.
To change the file used by the "Save" and "Load" buttons, edit the
type-in field at the top of the Variables dialog.

%Headers%
%headers_dialog%
The Mail Headers dialog lets you tell Z-Mail which
headers you wish to see, and which you wish to
ignore, when you read messages.  The "Headers..."
item in the Options menu of the ~#Main Window#~ brings
up the Mail Headers dialog.

The "headers" of a mail message are the lines at
the top containing delivery and subject
information.  Sometimes these headers can be quite
verbose, and of little interest to the casual
user.  For example, you are probably not
interested in the "Received" or "Errors-To"
headers of the message, since they describe
details of how the message got to you, and not the
message itself.

To reduce the clutter of unwanted message headers, you may "ignore"
named headers.  This will cause the named headers not to be displayed,
and will clean up the appearance of the message.  Headers typically
ignored include:

    Received
    Message-Id
    Status
 
If you want tighter control over what is displayed in the message
frame, you may specify which headers are the ones to display, and
Z-Mail will ignore ALL OTHER headers.  To choose this option, select
the "Show Only" toggle.  Typical settings for this are:

    From
    Subject
    Date
    Cc
 
The problem with setting explicit headers using "Show Only" is the
chance that Z-Mail will hide important headers which you may not have
anticipated wanting to see.

If you have headers set in the "Show Only" list, Z-Mail will show
only those headers, even if you toggle the Mail Headers dialog back to
the "Ignored Headers" list.  You must toggle "Show Only" and unset
all the Current Settings from that list in order for the "Ignored
Headers" to be in effect.

The displayed message may be saved, printed, deleted, preserved, 
unpreserved, marked, undeleted, pinned-up, unmarked and prioritized
from the Message menu.  Its displayed character set can also be
changed using the Message menu. Edit contains items for selecting and 
copying text, as well as scrolling and paging.

The Find menu may be used to read the next or previous message.  The 
"Next Reference By" and "Previous Reference By" pullrights from the
Find menu searche for another message related to the displayed message.
The "Search" item brings up a dialog for locating strings or patterns
in the text of the message.

The Reply menu gives choices to reply to only the sender of the
message, to all recipients of the message, and to either sender or all
recipients with a copy of the displayed message included in the
reply.  All items in this dialog call up a ~#Compose Window#~.  See
~#Replying to a Message#~ for more information.

The Forward menu allows you to resend the message or include its text
(labeled as "Forwarded mail") in the body of a new composition.  Resend
does not open a Compose Window, but instead prompts for an address and
sends a copy of the displayed message directly to that address. You may 
also forwardmessages as ~#attachments#~.

When you receive a message that has ~#attachments#~, the Message
Display Window adds a new area to the right of the Address Area.
The Attachments Area consists of a row of icons representing the
attachments you've received.  Each icon is labeled with the type of 
attachment it represents.  Click on any of the icons to display, play,
or in some way complete the receiving of the corresponding
attachment.  See ~#Attachments#~ for details of using this dialog.

%Search for Pattern%
%Search by Pattern%
%search_dialog%
The Pattern Search dialog lets you search messages in the active
folder, or all the open folders, for a pattern you specify.  Choose
the Pattern Search... item from the Find menu of the ~#Main Window#~
to bring up the Pattern Search dialog.

Use the text fields to specify both the pattern you want to look for
and its location.  You may specify patterns in several of these fields
to help narrow a search. For example, to find all messages from user
"bobg" that contain the phrase "combat boots" in the Subject: field,
you should do the following in the Pattern Search dialog:

  - Enter "bobg" in the From: text field
  - Enter "combat boots" in the Subject: text field

The field marked "Other" is used to search in non-standard
headers.  For example, to find messages that have an
"X-Security-Level" header containing the phrase "top
secret", replace the word "Other:" with "X-Security-Level:"
and type "top secret" in the next text field.

Click Search to begin a search.

When Z-Mail performs a search, it begins by looking for the pattern
specified in the "Other:" field.  If it finds messages that match, it
searches only those messages for the pattern specified in the Subject:
field, if there is one.  It continues searching the From: field, then
the To: field, then the message body, and lastly, the entire message,
if you've specified patterns in any of those fields.

Messages that match the search criteria are selected in the
Main Window, if you have the Select Matches toggle set.  If
you've set the View Only Matches toggle, only matching messages
will be displayed in the Main Window.  (Choose View All from
the View menu in the Main Window to display all the messages
in the current folder.)
%%<-shared-search
%%

%Extended Pattern Matching%
%regular expressions%
%regex%
When performing pattern searches, you may specify
the following regular expression operators when
the Extended Pattern Matching check box is turned on:

 .   matches anything except a newline.  The 
     expression 'a.b' matches any three-character 
     string which begins with 'a' and ends with 'b'.

 *   is a suffix indicating that the preceding 
     regular expression is to be repeated as many 
     times as possible.  For example, the expression 
     'fo*' matches 'f' followed by any number of 
     `o''s (including zero; 'fo* does match 'f').

     '*' always applies to the smallest possible 
     preceding expression.  So 'fo*' will not match 
     'fofo'.

 [ ] '[' begins a "character set", which is 
     terminated by a ']'. For example, '[ad]' matches 
     either `a' or `d', and      `[ad]*' matches any 
     string of `a''s and `d''s. 

     Character ranges can also be included in a 
     character set, by writing two characters 
     with a '-' between them.  Thus, '[a-z]' matches 
     any lower-case letter.  Ranges may be intermixed 
     freely with individual characters, as in 
     '[a-z$%.]', which matches any lower case letter 
     or '$', '%' or period.

     Note that the usual special characters are not 
     special any more inside a character set.  A 
     completely different set of special characters 
     exists inside character sets: `]', `-' and `^'.

     To include a `]' in a character set, you must 
     make it the first character.  For example, `[]a]' 
     matches `]' or `a'.  To include a `-', you must use 
     it in a context where it cannot possibly indicate a 
     range: that is, as the first character, or 
     immediately after a range.

 [^] '[^' begins a "complement character set", which 
     matches any character except the ones specified.  
     Thus, `[^a-z0-9A-Z]' matches all characters except
     letters and digits.

     `^' is not special in a character set unless it 
     is the first character.  The character following 
     the `^' is treated as if it were first (it may be 
     a `-' or a `]').

 +   '+' is like '*' except that at least one match 
     for the preceding pattern is required for `+'.  
     Thus, 'c[ao]+p' does not match 'cp' but does match 
     'cap' and 'cop'.

 ?   '?' is like '*' except that it allows either zero or 
     one match for the preceding pattern.  Thus, `c[ao]?p' 
     matches `cp' or `cap' or `cop', and nothing else.

 ^   is a special character that matches the empty string,
     but only if at the beginning of a line in the text 
     being matched. Otherwise it fails to match anything.  
     Thus, '^ugly' matches 'ugly' which occurs at the 
     beginning of a line.

 $   is similar to '^' but matches only at the end of a 
     line.  Thus, '-*$' matches a string of one or more 
     '-''s at the end of a line, and '^-*$' matches 
     lines that contain only '-''s.

 \   If you need to search for a character that is 
     itself a regular expression operator, you must 
     precede it with a backslash.  For example, to 
     search for lines that begin with one or more 
     asterisk characters, use '^\**'. 

 \|  specifies an alternative.  Two regular 
     expressions A and B with '\|' in between form 
     an expression that matches anything that either 
     A or B will match.  Thus, 'foo\|bar' matches either 
     'foo' or 'bar' but no other string.

     '\|' applies to the largest possible surrounding 
     expressions.  Only a surrounding '\( ... \)' 
     grouping can limit the grouping power of '\|'.

     Full backtracking capability exists when multiple 
     '\|''s are used.

 \( \)
     is a grouping construct that serves three 
     purposes:

       1. To enclose a set of '\|' alternatives for 
          other operations. Thus, '\(foo\|bar\)x' 
          matches either 'foox' or 'barx'.

       2. To enclose a complicated expression for the 
          postfix '*' to operate on.  Thus, 'ba\(na\)*' 
          matches 'bananana', etc., with any (zero or 
          more) number of 'na''s.

       3. To mark a matched substring for future 
          reference.

     This last application is not a consequence of the 
     idea of a parenthetical grouping; it is a separate 
     feature which happens to be assigned as a second 
     meaning to the same '\( ... \)' construct because 
     there is no conflict in practice between the
     two meanings.  Here is an explanation of this 
     feature:

 \DIGIT
     After the end of a '\( ... \)' construct, the 
     matcher remembers the beginning and end of the 
     text matched by that construct.  Then, later on 
     in the regular expression, you can use '\' followed 
     by DIGIT to mean "match the same text matched the
     DIGIT'th time by the '\( ... \)' construct."  The 
     '\( ... \)' constructs are numbered in order of 
     commencement in the expression.

     The strings matching the first nine '\( ... \)' 
     constructs appearing in a regular expression are 
     assigned numbers 1 through 9 in order of their 
     beginnings.  '\1' through '\9' may be used
     to refer to the text matched by the corresponding 
     '\( ... \)' construct.

     For example, '\(.*\)\1' matches any string that is 
     composed of two identical halves.  The '\(.*\)' 
     matches the first half, which may be anything, but 
     the '\1' that follows must match the same exact text.

 \b  matches the empty string, but only if it is at the 
     beginning or end of a word.  Thus, '\bfoo\b' matches 
     any occurrence of 'foo' as a separate word.  
     '\bball\(s\|\)\b' matches 'ball' or 'balls'
     as a separate word.

 \B  matches the empty string, provided it is not at

%Composing Messages%

You can compose and send new messages, edit and
forward existing messages, and compose a reply
to existing messages, using the Compose
Window. 

To send a new message, open a Compose Window
from the Main Window or while reading
messages in the Message Display Window.

To compose a new message,

  - Choose "Compose New" from the Compose
    menu, or click on the Compose button in 
    the Main Window.

For information about replying to and
forwarding messages, see ~#Replying to a Message#~
and ~#Forwarding Messages#~.

%%<Compose Window

%Compose Window%
%compose_window%
Compose new messages in the Compose Window.  There are several
ways to bring up a Compose Window:

  - Click "Compose" on the ~#Main Window#~.

  - Make a selection from the "Compose"
    menu on the Main Window.

  - Type Ctrl+N on the Main Window.

The Compose Window provides input fields for entering the addresses to
which your message should be sent and for the subject of the message,
and a simple text editor for entering the text
that you wish to send.  You can also include
~#attachments#~ with your composition.

Select the Editor... item of the Edit menu to
invoke the editor program you've specified in the
~#visual#~ variable.  Your composition appears
in the editor program.  When you quit the editor
program, your edited composition reappears in
the Compose Window.

You must specify at least one addressee before you can send a
message.  See ~#Entering Addresses#~ for more information about addressing
your message.

You can include other messages and files in your composition.  See
~#Including Messages and Files#~ for more information.

See ~#Sending a Message#~ for more information about sending completed
compositions.

You can save a partially-completed composition in a file with the
"Save as Draft" or "Write to File..." items of the Message menu.  
"Save as Draft" saves the entire message, which includes the 
message header. "Write to File..." saves only the message body.

To restart the composition later, use the Compose->Drafts->View Drafts
menu item on the Main window to open the folder to which you saved
your composition.  Then select the message you wish to restart and use
the Compose->Drafts->Resume Draft menu item.

You can start a new composition using a pre-defined template with the
Templates item of the Message menu.  See ~#Templates#~ for more
information.

See ~#Formatting Text#~ for information about
formatting the text of your composition.

See ~#Search and Replace#~ for information about
using the Search and Replace dialog (in the Edit
menu).  See ~#Spell Checking#~ for information
about using an interactive spell checker or 
the spell checking facility of the Search and 
Replace dialog.

The Options menu controls how your message is composed and delivered.
The "Options..." item brings up the ~#Compose Options#~ dialog, which
provides more detailed control over these selections.

Setting "Edit Headers" in the Compose Options
dialog changes the appearance of the Compose
Window.  When this option is selected, the
addressing and subject fields disappear, and the
complete set of message headers for your message
appears in the text editor.  You may edit the
contents of these headers (anything to the right
of the colon (:) in each header line) in the same
way that you edit the text of your message.
However, unless you are familiar with electronic
mail transport, you should not edit or remove the
header labels themselves.  Also be careful to
leave a blank line between the headers and the
text of your message.

The Aliases item from the Address menu calls up an abbreviated version
of the Aliases dialog.  From this dialog, you can browse your list of
aliases and select aliases to which to address your message.  See
~#Using Aliases#~ for details.  

A Toolbar is available for the Compose Window. To invoke the
Toolbar, pull down the Layout Menu, and select Toolbar. For
a description of the default Toolbar icons, please refer to
~#Toolbar#~.

the window provides additional delivery options.  If you
decide you don't want to send the message you're composing,
click the "Cancel" button.  After sending or canceling your
message, click the "Done" button to dismiss the window.

Once you have selected Send, your message is on its way and
cannot be retrieved or canceled.

Click "Cancel" in the popup if you wish to send the message before 
dismissing the Compose Window.  Click "OK" to abort the composition 
and dismiss the Compose Window.

Depending on your Z-Mail configuration, the Compose Window may be
automatically dismissed or iconified when you send or cancel.  The

%Address Entry%
Enter addresses into the Address Area, which is just below the Messages List 
and just above the Subject Area of a ~#Compose Window#~.
  
To enter an address or addresses:
  
  1. Select an address option by pulling up the Address
     Option Menu, labeled "To:" and in the upper left 
     corner of the Address Area.
  
     Address options and their indications are:
  
       To    Indicates the primary recipients
  
       Cc    Indicates "Carbon copy" recipients
  
       Bcc   Indicates "Blind carbon copy" recipients
  
     Message headers contain lines that indicate 
     recipients in the "To" and "Cc" lists. Recipients 
     in the "Bcc" list are not recorded in out-bound mail.
  
  2. Type the recipient's address in the Address Entry 
     Area, which is to the right of the Address Option 
     Menu. 
  
     You can type in more than one address in the Address 
     Entry Area, provided you separate local addresses with 
     spaces:
  
       pat chris robin shawn
  
     When typing in more than one complex address, separate 
     the addresses with commas and spaces:
  
       pat@circus.com, chris@daisies.org, robin@buzzer.edu
  
     If an address is more complex than those above, you
     will probably want to type in one address only.
  
  3. After typing in the address or addresses, press RETURN. 
     After pressing RETURN, Z-Mail adds the address to the
     Address List, which is below the Address Entry Area
     and above the Subject Area. 
  
To add an address to your address list at any time during your message composition,
repeat the steps listed above.

%Address Forms%
A mail address can be a:
    
    user's login name and mail routing information
  
    mail alias
  
    file name
  
    program
  
The simplest addresses are the login names of local users, such as "pat".
These simple addresses are referred to as "local addresses."
  
Addresses not on your own system are called "remote addresses."
More complex remote addresses may access external networks and gateways.  
   
Remote addresses contain characters such as "!", "@" and "%" 
which separate host names and gateways from the user name.
  
Domain addresses (also called Arpanet, Internet, RFC822, and "fully
qualified" addresses) are specified as
  
    user@host.domain
   
where "domain" is usually a compound name such as "berkeley.edu" or
"z-code.com".  This is the most common form of electronic addressing.
   
Another form of addressing describes the UUCP (UNIX-to-UNIX CoPy) path
used to transmit a message:
  
    host1!host2!user
   
where there may be as many hosts as necessary to route the message to
the recipient user.  In the example above, the "user" account is on
"host2" and that machine is connected to "host1".  Your machine should
have a UUCP connection to "host1" in this case.  UUCP addressing is
becoming less common, but you may still see it occasionally.
  
UUCP and Domain addresses are sometimes mixed:
  
    host2!user@host1.domain
  
This tells the local system to transmit the message to host1 in the
named domain, with the expectation that host1 will then UUCP the
message to host2.  Delivery to "user" occurs on host2.
  
A `%' character has the same meaning as `@', but its interpretation is
delayed until the message has crossed the uucp connection:
  
    host1!user%host2.domain
   
The above example tells the local system to UUCP the message to host1,
with the expectation that host1 will transmit the message to host2 in
the named domain.  Again, delivery to "user" occurs on host2.
  
Mixing of addresses in this way is discouraged, but it is sometimes
required to assure delivery.  The complete syntax and ramifications of
inter-network mailing are too complex to cover here.  More information
can be obtained through your system manager.
  
If a recipient is a file name, it must be a full pathname beginning with
slash (/), tilde (~) (meaning the user's home directory) or plus (+)
(meaning the user's folder directory).
  
If a recipient is a program, is must begin with the pipe symbol
(vertical bar, "|") and be enclosed in angle brackets:
  
    <|program arguments ...>
  
Note that because < and > have a special meaning to the mail system,
programs to which mail is sent cannot use shell input and output
redirection.  The arguments to a program also must not include comma
(,) characters.  Commas are used by the mail system to separate one
address from another.
  
See ~#Address Editing#~ for information about using the Address Area.

@@ifndef ZMAIL_BASIC
%Address Browser%
%-Browser%
The Address Browser dialog provides an interactive interface to the
~#address_book#~ program, also known as the "directory service".  If
you have such a program available, this dialog acts as a "phone book"
to look up electronic mail ~#addresses#~ for you.

Type a pattern of the form expected by your address book program in
the Pattern field and click Search.  If Z-Mail has remembered the
result of a previous lookup of that pattern, the remembered result
appears in the Recalls field.  The address book program is also
executed, and the results are displayed in the Matches area.  This
permits the remembered lookup to be verified against the current
address book information.

The Edit menu provides Remember and Forget functions.  If Remember
is selected, Z-Mail stores the contents of the Pattern and Recalls
fields.  At any time thereafter, when the Pattern string is used to
address a message, the address from the Recalls field is used.  This
behavior is controlled by the variable ~#address_cache#~.

If Forget is selected, any remembered address associated with the
value of the Pattern field is forgotten.  If the Pattern field is
empty, Z-Mail looks for the first pattern that corresponds to the
value of the Recalls field, and forgets that pattern instead.  If
several patterns recall the same address, only one is forgotten.

Forget All causes the list of all remembered addresses, not just
those matching the Pattern or Recalls fields, to be discarded.  

The Display toggles below the Matches area allow you to change the
view to show either any descriptive text generated by your address
book program, or the actual electronic mail addresses associated
with each description.  For example, your address book program
might return:
 
   Fred Jones, President, Jones Inc.
   <fred@fjones.com>
 
If Descriptions is selected, the Matches area displays only the
text "Fred Jones, President, Jones Inc.".  If Addresses is selected,
the Matches area displays the address <fred@fjones.com>.

The Options menu provides access to the ~#Aliases~ui#~ dialog,
where your personal addressing shorthands (aliases) are stored.
When sending a message, aliases are always substituted before either
the remembered patterns or the address book are consulted.

See the ~#address_book#~ and ~#lookup_sep#~ variables for interface
specifications of the address book program.

Note that the ~#address_filter#~ is not applied when browsing.

    Record File:  This identifies a file to which all
      outgoing mail is copied.  (See the "record"
      variable.)
 
    Log File:  Like the record file, outgoing messages
      are copied here; unlike the record file, only
      message HEADERS are copied.  (See the "logfile"
      variable.)
 
    Autosign:  When set, the value of your "autosign"
      variable is used as an addendum to your outgoing
      mail.
 
    Autoformat:  Z-Mail attempts to automatically format
      your mail before it goes out.  You may type text
      without pressing RETURN at the ends of lines, and
      Z-Mail will figure out where to "wrap" the lines.
 
    Return-Receipt:  When the recipient receives your
      mail, a confirming message is mailed back to you
      automatically.
 
    Edit Headers:  This allows you to change the way you
      edit the headers of your message.  When turned on,
      the "To:", "Cc:", "Subject:" lines and other headers
      appear in the same text area as the body of the
      message you are composing; they can then be edited
      like normal text.  See the "edit_hdrs" variable.
 
    Verbose:  This causes verbose output to be generated
      by the transport agent when it delivers mail.
 
    Synch Send:  This causes Z-Mail to wait for each
      message to be sent before returning control to
      the user.
 
    Autoclear:  After sending mail, the Compose Window
      text-composition area is cleared of all text.  (See
      the "autoclear" variable.)
 
    Record-User:  When sending mail, if there exists a
      folder in your folder directory (see the "folder"
      variable) that has the same name as a recipient of
      your mail, then a copy of your message is
      automatically recorded in that folder.  (Note, the

%Formatting Text%
The ~#Compose Window#~ provides several mechanisms for formatting the text
of your composition.  In addition to the standard Motif Cut, Copy, and Paste,
Z-Mail provides the following tools under the Edit
menu of the Compose Window:

The Paste Special pullright of the Edit menu
performs the following two functions:

  - "Indent" pastes the contents of
    the clipboard (the last text you Cut or
    Copied) at the insertion cursor like a normal
    Paste, but also "indents" the text by
    preceding every line with "> ".  See the
    ~#indent_str#~ variable if you wish to change the
    default characters with which the text is
    indented.

  - "Fill" pastes the contents of
    the clipboard (the last text you Cut or
    Copied) at the insertion cursor like a normal
    Paste, but also "fills" each pasted line by
    rearranging the line breaks so that each line
    is as long as possible without exceeding the
    setting of the ~#wrapcolumn#~ variable (78
    characters by default)

The Format pullright of the Edit menu performs the
following four functions on a selected region of
text:

  - "Fill" fills each line in the region by
    rearranging the line breaks so that each line
    is as long as possible without exceeding the
    setting of the ~#wrapcolumn#~ variable (78
    characters by default)

  - Indent "indents" the text by preceding every
    line with "> ".  See the ~#indent_str#~
    variable if you wish to change the default
    characters with which the text is indented.

  - Unindent removes characters that occur at the
    beginning of each line of the selected region.

  - Pipe through Command... sends the selected
    region though the UNIX command you specify,
    replacing the selected region with the output
    of the command.

%Editing Text%
In addition to using the Cut, Copy, and Paste menu items to edit text,
in text areas, you may also use several keystrokes to position the
cursor, scroll the display, delete text and insert new lines.  These
key bindings are similar to those used in the Emacs editor and are
provided as defaults; you or your system administrator may override
them.

%Including Messages and Files%
%including%
While you are Composing a message, you can include other messages and
files into your composition with the "Include" menu of the
~#Compose Window#~.

To include other messages in your composition, select one of the
items from the Include->Messages pullright.  The message(s) with the
number(s) indicated in the ~#Messages: field#~ of the Compose Window
will be included in your message.  The three ways to include a message are:

  - Indented, which prepends "> " to
    every line of the included message.
    See the ~#pre_indent_str#~, ~#indent_str#~,
    and ~#post_indent_str#~ variables for
    details.

  - Nonindented, which precedes and follows
    the included message with a comment of the
    form:
      --- Forwarded mail from <user>
      ...message here...
      --- End of forwarded mail from <user>

  - As Attachment(s), which attaches each included
    message as a ~#MIME#~ "message/rfc822" attachment
    instead of placing it in the body of your
    composition.  This is useful for forwarding
    each message with comments but without
    modification, so that all headers and
    attachments are retained.

To include a file (or files) in your composition, select one of the
items from the Include->File pullright of the Include menu.  Both
items bring up a ~#File Finder#~, where you specify the file to include.

  - The Insert... item inserts the contents
    of the file you specify at the
    insertion cursor in the message body.

  - The Replace... item replaces the entire
    contents of the composition in progress
    with the file you specify.  If you
    have set Edit Headers in the Compose
    Options dialog, headers in the message
    body will be replaced as well.
%%

%Attachments%
Attachments are files that are "attached" to messages,
rather than "inserted" in message bodies.
Attachments may be text, binary, or executable
files.  

Inserting files into the body of a mail
message can be cumbersome.  You may have to
use several programs to properly encode the file
for safe delivery, and the recipient will have
to extract the file from the mail message and
use several programs to decode the file before
they can view it.

However, when files are attached to mail messages,
Z-Mail automatically encodes them for safe delivery.
If the recipient is also a Z-Mail user, they can
easily view an attachment or save it as a file
of its own, separate from the mail message delivered
with it.

See ~#Receiving Attachments#~ and ~#Sending Attachments#~
for more information.

Z-Mail uses the ~#MIME#~ (Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions) draft standard for handling
attachments.
%%

%Receiving Attachments%

When you receive a message containing attachments, a row
of icons appears to the right of the message headers
display area of the ~#Message Display Window#~. To view an 
attachment, click on its icon. 

Attachments can be "detached" from messages and saved
as files.  To do this, choose Attachments from the 
Message menu of the ~#Message Display Window#~.

%%<-attachments_dialog_receiving
%%

%Sending Attachments%
To send an attachment, bring up the  ~#Attachments dialog#~ 
by choosing the "Attachments..." item from the Message Menu
in the ~#Compose Window#~.
%%<-attachments_dialog_sending
%%

%MIME%
Z-Mail conforms to the new draft Internet standard message format.
The Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) extend the standard
RFC822 message format.  They facilitate interoperability across
mailers and platforms for messages with multiple parts or attachments,
enabling exchange of multimedia information such as pictures, sounds,
and voice, as well as text in different character sets.

If you are exchanging multimedia messages with users of other
MIME-compliant mail programs or Z-Mail users at other sites, you
should be careful to avoid using "extended" MIME attachment types in
the Attachments dialog.  Extended types are indicated by an "x-" in
their names.

By avoiding the use of extended types, you will improve the chances
that the recipients of your multimedia message will be able to
successfully view it.

and to detach attachments from messages you've received.
%%<-attachments_dialog_receiving

%-attachments_dialog_receiving%
To save an attachment you've received, select its name in the 
Attached Documents list.  By default, the File: field will
display the name the file had on the sender's system.  If you
want to save the file under a different name, specify it
in the File: field.  Click Save to save the file.

To display an attachment using this dialog, select the attachment
in the list and click Display.  (You may also display attachments
by clicking on their icons in the ~#Message Display Window#~.)

Normally, you should not have to change the settings of the
File Type or Encoding menus in order to display or save an attachment.
However, if the File Type or the Encoding menus display "Unknown", the
attachment was sent using a type that is not defined on your system.
The actual type used is shown in the Attached Documents list.  To
display such an attachment, you must change the File Type and/or
Encoding menus to another equivalent type.  If you cannot determine an
equivalent type, Z-Mail cannot display the attachment.  You may still
detach the attachment, but if the encoding is not known the attachment
is written in its encoded form for later decoding.
%%<Attachment Types
%%

%-attachments_dialog_sending%
You may either attach an existing file to composition, or you
may create one using the New button.

To attach an existing file to a composition, specify its name
in the File: field.  

Then, set the File Type and Encoding menus
appropriately using the dialog that appears.

The File Type menu indicates the type of the file you
are sending.  This determines what program to
execute to display the attachment when it is
received, and may also determine whether the
file must be encoded for safe inclusions in the
message. 

If you don't know what type of file you are
sending, or if it does not appear in the File
Type menu, select the type "application/octet stream".

An Encoding must be used if you want to send
binary data.  This encoding is usually
"base64" for ~#MIME#~ compliance.
If you are uncertain what encoding to use,
select "None".  Z-Mail Lite will automatically supply
an encoding when one is required, even if the
Encoding menu is set to "None".

You may also use this dialog to provide an
additional comment for the attachment.

Once you have specified the name, type, and encoding for the file,
click Attach to attach it.

If the autotyper variable is set, you may select the Autotype to 
cause Z-mail to use an autotyper program to determine the type
of the attachment.

Set the autotyper variable to the name of an autotyper program.
An autotyper program takes the name of a file being attached to 
a message and returns an appropriate MIME-type name.

Autotyper programs are not provided by default, but the following
examples are available in $ZMAIL/bin:

type-by-magic: Checks the magic number of a file to determine its
                         format.

type-by-suffix: Checks the suffix of a file's name to determine its
		         format. This script does not look at the file's 
			 contents.

When sending ~#attachments#~, the File field indicates the pathname of the
file to be attached.  When detaching, this name will be used, with all
leading directory information removed, as the name of the file in
which to store the detached attachment.  

If you wish to create a new file to attach, such as an audio message,
set the File Type and Encoding menus and click the New button.  The
File field is ignored in this case, and a new temporary file is
created.  Z-Mail then executes the editor program defined for the type
of attachment you are creating.

At the bottom of the Attachments dialog is an Attached Documents list
summarizing the name, type, and size of each attachment to the
message.  When attaching files to a composition, the size of the
attachment depends on the setting of the Encoding menu, so
the size is shown as "pending" in the list.  

If you decide not to send a particular attachment, select it in the
Attached Documents list and click Unattach.

If you change the File Type or Encoding for an attachment before
sending, be certain to click the attach button again to re-attach the
file with the new type or encoding.  If you do not click the Attach
button, changes to the type or encoding have no effect.
%%

%Attachment Types%
Z-Mail determines how to encode and display attachments according
to the file attach.types in the Z-Mail library.  If you frequently
receive attachments for which the File Type or Encoding are "unknown",
notify your system administrator.

You may define your own types by placing them in a file and setting
the variable "attach_types" to contain the file's full pathname.
Refer to the attach.types file and the Z-Mail Reference Manual to see
how to construct entries in your own attachment-types file. See
~#MIME#~ for more information about the mechanism Z-Mail uses for
attachment handling.

%File Finder%
%file_finder%
The File Finder is used in several dialogs to search for files
(including mail folders) and directories.  It consists of a list of
file and directory names and a type-in field.  Below the type-in field
are other controls specific to the dialog using the file finder.

Select an item from the list to copy its name to the type-in field.
Double-click on a directory name to examine the contents of that
directory.  In most cases, double-clicking on a file name causes the
default action to be applied to that file.  Sometimes when there is
more than one possible action you must explicitly select the action
rather than double-clicking.  However, double clicking a directory
always examines that directory.

Turn on the "Hidden Files" toggle to see files whose name begins
with a dot (.) character.  The parent directory (..) is always shown
so that you can navigate up the file tree by double-clicking on the
parent directory item.

When the  "Folders Only" toggle is on, only files that are
mail folders are displayed.  Directories and the parent directory
(..) are displayed as usual.
%%

%Filters%
Z-Mail allows you to create filters to automatically perform
actions on certain incoming mail messages.  For example, you
can use a filter to automatically save messages containing
the phrase "combat boots" to a folder.

You may create filters that act upon messages based on:

        - The date they were received
        - A text pattern in any header or the message body.

Filtered messages may be automatically:

        - Saved to a file
        - Deleted
        - Forwarded to another address
        - Replied to, or
        - Passed through any Z-Script function.

The ~#Filters dialog#~ is used to create filters.
%%

%Filters Dialog%
%filters_dialog%

To access the Filters dialog, choose Filters from the Options
menu in the Main Window.

To filter messages that contain a text pattern, click
on Filter By Pattern.  To filter messages based on
the date they were received, click Filter By Date.

The upper right hand portion of the Filters dialog
changes depending on which of these items you've 
chosen. 

If you choose Filter By Date, use the check boxes
to specify the age of message you want to filter.

If you choose Filter by Pattern, specify a pattern
in the Search Pattern: field and use the check boxes
to indicate where the pattern must be found. 

Use to pop-up menu to specify what action should
be performed on the filtered messages.  The text
field below this pop-up changes depending on which 
action you choose.

        - If you choose Save to File or Copy to File, specify 
	  the name of the file to which messages should
          be saved.

        - If you choose Save by Author or Save by
          Subject, the name of the file will be
          either the sender or the subject of the
          message.  Use the text field to specify
          the directory where these files should
          be stored.

        - If you choose Mark, messages which match
	   will become marked. To unmark messages
	   which match a filter, select Unmark.
        
        - If you choose Delete, messages which match
	   will be deleted when you update the folder. To 
	   undelete messages which match a filter, select 
	   Undelete.

       - If you choose Forward, specify the 
          e-mail address to which messages should
          be resent.

        - If you choose reply, specify the name of
          a file that contains the text of the reply.

        - If you choose Z-Script, specify the name 
          of the Z-Script function which should be invoked.

If you turn on Filter New Mail Only, only new mail
will be filtered.  If you don't turn on this box,
all the messages in your system mailbox will be 
filtered, but only when you invoke Z-Mail
with the -filter option:

        zmail -gui -filter

Finally, specify a name for the filter and click Install
to install it.  

To delete an existing filter, select its name in the 
Installed Filters list and click Delete.

%Custom Headers%
You may create your own customized mail headers
for outgoing mail using the Envelope dialog, which
may be accessed by choosing Envelope... from the
Options menu in the Main Window.

Headers you define in this dialog  will appear 
on your outgoing messages.  Common customized 
headers include your phone number, address, organization, 
and other personal information.  Examples:

    Organization: Z-Code Software Corporation
    X-Phones: (415) 898-UNIX
    Reply-To: argv@z-code.com
 
A header name must consist of one word without spaces.  Multi-word
header names are usually separated by dashes, as in "Reply-To" above.
The header usually contains a single line of text.
If the header you are creating is not a standard
RFC822 header, or you aren't sure, always precede
the name of the header with "X-" as in the
"X-Phones" example above.

@@ifndef ZMAIL_BASIC
You may also use this dialog to create Dynamic Headers.
Unlike other headers, you may set dynamic headers to
a particular value for a composition by choosing
Dynamic... from the Address menu in the Compose Window.

headers appear.  Use these pop-ups to set the value of the
headers for this composition.  By default, dynamic headers
are set to "Unset Header", which means that they do no 
appear on an outgoing message unless you explicitly set them.

%X-Face%
You can attach a small picture of yourself to your outgoing mail using
the X-Face header.  If the recipient is also using Z-Mail, your face will
show up in the message-reading Window instead of the letter-and-envelope
icon.  A few other mail programs also display X-Faces.

To make your own X-Face, you need an image of yourself and some tools
for manipulating bitmaps.  You have to convert the picture to be
black&white and exactly 48x48 pixels in size.  Let's run through an
example assuming that you have an image in GIF format and you're using
the freely-available PBMPLUS toolkit:

 % giftoppm face.gif | \      # convert to PPM
   ppmtopgm | \               # color to grayscale, if necessary
   pgmnorm | \                # normalize grayscale contrast
   pnmscale -xy 48 48 | \     # scale to at most 48x48
   pgmtopbm > face.pbm        # convert to PBM

At this point you have an Nx48 or 48xN bitmap, and you have to make it
square.  There's no simple pipeline to do this, but here's one way:

 % pnmfile face.pbm           # look at size
 face.pbm: PBM raw, 37 by 48
 % bc
 (48 - 37) / 2                # compute x offset for paste
 5
 % pbmmake -white 48 48 | \   # make white background bitmap
   pnmpaste face.pbm 5 0 | \  # paste in the face
   pbmtoicon | \              # convert to Sun icon format
   tail +3 | \                # remove unnecessary header stuff
   compface > face.xface      # convert to X-Face

This produces a string such as:

 ,Ds44dHMpgZWe_mQHw>6_G=nh*w!PSv@Pn"}Q4{q}~^Zwt`4_"awA

If the string is more than one line, join the lines and remove blanks.
Replace any single quotes with single double single double single
('"'"'), and then wrap that in a my_hdr command using single quotes:

 my_hdr X-Face: ',Ds44dHMpgZWe_mQHw>6_G=nh*w!PSv@Pn"}Q4{q}~^Zwt`4_"awA'

And put it in your ~/.zmailrc!
