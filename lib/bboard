function bboard() {
#% usage: bboard folder
# This function opens the given folder as a shared bulletin board.
# This is just like a regular folder, but it is opened as "read-only"
# so you can't actually update the folder (delete messages, etc).
# Instead, this information is saved in a file called ".<foldername>"
# in your home directory.  When you call "update", the folder is not
# actually updated, but the message status information as if you were
# to update is written to the dot-file.  Note, this means that the
# only way to exit a bulletin board is to call "update" rather than
# "close", etc... (Of course, you could write a "close" function.)
