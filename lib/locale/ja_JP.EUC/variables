#
#  Note that the ternary conditional scheme above means that setting
#  a default value to a string that matches one of the conditionals
#  (e.g. "is_gui") is impossible.  Ternary conditionals may omit the
#  false case, and may use other defaults as their true/false cases,
#  e.g. "is_gui?*" is equivalent to "*" when is_gui, otherwise empty.
#  An omitted false case is not the same as "NONE".  Multivalues may
#  have a comma-separated list of ternaries.
#
#  If a variable is boolean and string/multivalue, the first word on the
#  line indicates the default boolean condition and the rest of the line
#  indicates the value assumed when the variable is set (boolean TRUE).
#  "gui compose" means that if the program is running in gui mode, then
#  "compose" is the default value.
#  If the first word is NONE instead of FALSE, no value is assumed.
#
#  If the first word is "*", the rest of the line may indicate a value to
#  be used when no other value can be determined.  This will not override
#  variables that are "set" internally, but WILL override internal values
#  that are used as defaults for "unset" variables (e.g. DEF_PROMPT).

alternates
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string
NONE
ホスト:
When you reply to messages, Z-Mail does not send a copy of the message
to your login name at any of the hosts listed on the alternates list.
Hosts may be specified either as a single machine name or as a UUCP
path, using "!" characters to separate machine names.

The symbol "*" in the alternates list matches your login name at any
host.  For instance, if you are bobg@zyrcon.com, then "*" means "do
not reply to bobg@andrew.cmu.edu or uunet!bobg or anyone else whose ID
is bobg".  If the "*" is followed immediately by some name, then that
name is used in place of your login ID.  If you have another login
name on the local or remote machine, then that login may be specified
either as
    user@machine
or by preceding the login name or a UUCP path to the login name by a
"!" character, as
    !machine!user
The leading "!" character tells Z-Mail that the path ends in a login
name.  Without the "!", Z-Mail will append your login name.

Note that the ~#alternates~cmd#~ command changes the value of this variable.
%%

--
alwaysexpand
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
Setting alwaysexpand will cause mail address ~#aliases#~ to be expanded
when they appear in the To, Cc, and Bcc fields of an outgoing message.

To prevent a composition from being delivered with expanded aliases,
set the ~#no_expand#~ variable after starting a composition but before
sending the message.

Alwaysexpand has no effect when defining new ~#aliases#~ via the ~#alias#~
Z-Script command or in the GUI and Lite interface ~#Aliases#~ dialogs.
%%

alwaysignore
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean multivalue
# default values:
TRUE forward,include
# number of multi-values in variable:
4
# list the values:
forward
Discard ~#ignored headers#~ when forwarding messages.
%%
include
Discard ~#ignored headers#~ when including a message in your composition.
%%
pipe
Discard ~#ignored headers#~ when passing a message to an external program.
%%
printer
Discard ~#ignored headers#~ when printing messages.
%%
Conditions:
If set with no value, the mail ~#headers#~ set by the ~#ignore~cmd#~
command are always ignored.  Normally, ~#ignored headers#~ are not
ignored when sending messages to the printer, or when including
messages in a composition.  Setting alwaysignore will ignore those
~#headers#~ even in these situations.  No ~#headers#~ can be ignored
during ~#update~ui#~s or when using the ~#save#~ command.  This is to prevent
the user from inadvertently ignoring ~#headers#~ that are required
internally by Z-Mail and other mail systems.
%%

--
always_sort
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
Setting always_sort will cause the system mailbox to be sorted
whenever new mail arrives there.  This variable is ignored if
the variable ~#sort#~ is not set.  If ~#sort#~ is set, but always_sort
is not set, then the system mailbox will only be sorted upon
entering Z-Mail, and new mail will be added unsorted to the end of
the mailbox.

NOTE: If you have always_sort set, the message numbers of messages
may change every time new mail arrives.  If you have always_sort
set, you should be very careful about performing actions on groups
of messages that you specify only by message number.  For example,
if you issue the command:

        ~#pick#~ -f Fred

all messages from Fred will be selected.  If new mail
arrives, all the messages in the folder will be renumbered,
but the same messages numbers will remain selected.
If you issue the command:

        ~#delete#~

to delete the selected messages, you may be deleting
that aren't from Fred and that you haven't read yet.

%%

--
ask
tty fullscreen gui mswindows boolean
TRUE
NULL
Prompt for a subject when composing outgoing messages.  When using
the "edit headers" mode, causes an empty Subject: header line to be
placed in the ~#editor~var#~ file.  See also ~#edit_hdrs#~.
%%

--

NULL

Prompt for a list of Blind Carbon Copy recipients whenever sending
mail.
%%

--
askcc
tty fullscreen gui mswindows boolean
is_gui?TRUE:is_lite
NULL
Prompt for a list of Carbon Copy recipients whenever sending mail.
When using the "edit headers" mode, causes an empty Cc: header line
to be placed in the ~#editor~var#~ file.  See also ~#edit_hdrs#~.
%%

attach_prune_size
gui numeric gui_max=1048576
10240
Bytes:
This variable specifies the cutoff point for pruning
large attachments from mail messages when the Prune
Large Parts toggle is on in the Save dialog.
%%

--
attach_types
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string
NONE
File Name:
This variable specifies a file where encoding keys and file types for
~#attachments#~ are defined.  Your system has a default file with some of
these definitions.  The file named by attach_types may give
alternate or additional encodings and types.

The command "~#attach~cmd#~ -rehash" must be used to reload the attachment
type definitions if you either change the value of ~#attach_types#~ or
modify the file while Z-Mail is running.
%%

--
autoclear
mac mswindows gui boolean
FALSE
NULL
Erase the text area of the ~#Compose window#~ after sending a message.
This is useful only if ~#autodismiss#~ is not used to remove the window.
Use this if you wish to leave the ~#Compose window#~ open but you are
concerned that passers-by be prevented from reading the message text
on your screen.
%%

--
autodismiss
mac lite gui mswindows multivalue
# default values:

# number of multi-values
7
# list each multi-value
alias
Close the Aliases dialog after mailing to an alias.
%%
compose
Close the ~#Compose window#~ after sending or cancelling a message.
%%
message
Close the ~#Message Display window#~ when the displayed message is
~#delete~cmd#~d, unless ~#autoprint#~ is set and another message to display can
be found.  Note that one of ~#show_deleted~var#~ or ~#autoprint#~ must be set
in order for the ~#Message Display window#~ to remain open when the displayed
message is ~#delete#~d.
%%
open
Close the Open Folder dialog after opening a folder.
%%
print
Close the Print Messages dialog after printing.
%%
save
Close the Save dialog after ~#saving#~.
%%
templates
Close the ~#Templates#~ dialog after selecting a template.
%%
Conditions:
In GUI mode, automatically dismiss (close) selected windows after
performing an operation.
Setting ~#autodismiss#~ without giving any
conditions is equivalent to setting all the possible conditions.
If ~#autoiconify#~ is also set, it may override one or more of the
conditions for ~#autodismiss#~.
%%

--
autodisplay
gui mswindows boolean string
FALSE
Keywords:
This variable may be set to a space- or comma-separated list of
attachment type keywords.  If a message is received that contains
an attachment of one of the listed types, that attachment is
automatically displayed when the message is read.

Autodisplay is performed only in GUI mode.  To display a message
without automatically displaying its ~#attachments#~, type its number
(and only its number) in the Command: field of the ~#Main window#~ and
press return.
%%

--
autoedit
tty fullscreen gui mswindows boolean multivalue
FALSE
2
new
Invoke the editor when composing new messages.
%%
reply
Invoke the editor when replying to messages.
%%
Conditions:
Automatically enter your editor of choice when composing outgoing
messages.  If set, but not to any values, the editor is always started
when a composition is begun.  Otherwise, the editor is started only in
the specified circumstances.
%%

--
autoformat
mac gui mswindows lite boolean multivalue
# default values
FALSE
# number of options
1
# list the options
compose
Automatically wrap text (according to the value of wrapcolumn) in the
~#Compose window#~.
%%
NULL
Cause text to be "word-wrapped" when lines are too long to fit in the
window.  For the Message Display window, text wraps at the width of
the window.  For the Compose window, text wraps at the column
specified by ~#wrapcolumn#~ (and relieves you of needing to press
RETURN at the ends of lines).  If wrapcolumn is not set, the width of
the Compose window is used.

When composing messages, it is recommended that text wrap earlier than
column 80, since 80 columns is a reasonable guess about the width of
the recipient's display.  (Lines longer than the width of the display
are often difficult to read.)  In fact, for heightened readability,
many consider 72 to be the ideal value for wrapcolumn.

After you compose a message, autoformat may alter it to look slightly
different from what you saw on the screen.  When precise line-wrapping
is important, you are encouraged to manually insert newlines into the
text rather than rely on the formatting characteristics of autoformat.

If this variable is set, but not to any value, it behaves as if it
were set to "compose".
Autoformatting is not performed in Z-Mail's command-line interface.
%%

autoiconify
gui mswindows multivalue
# default values:

# number of options
3
# list the options, each separated by "%%"
alias
Close the Aliases dialog after mailing to an alias.
%%
compose
Iconify the ~#Compose window#~ after sending or cancelling a message.
%%
message
Iconify the ~#Message Display window#~ when the displayed message is
~#delete~cmd#~d, unless ~#autoprint#~ is set and another message to display can
be found.  Note that one of ~#show_deleted~var#~ or ~#autoprint#~ must be set
in order for the ~#Message Display window#~ to remain open when the displayed
message is ~#delete#~d.
%%
Conditions:
In GUI mode, automatically iconify selected windows after performing
an operation.  If both ~#autodismiss#~ and ~#autoiconify#~ are set for a
particular window, the window will be iconified.  Setting ~#autoiconify#~
without any specific conditions is equivalent to setting all of the
possible conditions.
%%

--
autoinclude
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
When replying to mail, a copy of the message being replied to
is automatically inserted into your message body, indented by
the string described by ~#indent_str#~.

See also the ~#pre_indent_str#~ and ~#post_indent_str#~ variables.
%%

--
autoprint
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
is_gui?TRUE:is_lite
NULL
Automatically display the ~#next#~ message on the list when a message
is ~#delete#~d.
%%

--
auto_route
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean string
NONE
Host/Path:
Remove redundant UUCP hostnames when replying to messages.  If set
(but not to a text string), all the recipients in a message that is
being replied to will be routed through the path back to the original
author.  If auto_route is set to a specific pathname (host names
separated by `!'s), all addresses in the reply will have this route
prepended before redundant hosts are removed.  This variable is
normally set by the system administrator if it is needed.
%%

--
autosave_count
lite gui numeric gui_max=1000
100
Value:
This variable controls how often the composition will be automatically saved
to a temporary file in GUI mode.  It specifies the number of keystrokes
between saves.
%%

--
autosign
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean string
FALSE ~/.signature
Filename:
Append a signature to outgoing mail.  If this variable is set, but not
to a string, then the file
.signature in your home directory
is used.

If set to a string beginning with a backslash -- \like this -- or
enclosed in square braces -- [like this] -- then these strings
(without the backslash or square braces) are added directly to the
message instead of being treated as file names.

By default, the string is interpreted as a filename, and the contents
of the named file are used as the signature.
A leading ~ or + character is expanded to your home or folder
directory, respectively.

If set to a string that starts with an exclamation point (!), the
remainer of the string is interpreted as a command and run in a shell.
The addresses of the message are passed to the command as arguments,
and the output of the command is used as the signature.
%%

--
autosign2
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string
NONE
Addr:File:
This alternate signature is available for special cases where a
signature different than the regular ~#autosign#~ is desired.  The
format for this variable is:

 autosign2 = "address1, address2, ... : signature"

where address1, address2, ... may be specific users' addresses
or may have one of the forms:

  !hostname     any user at the named host (usually your own)
  @domain       any user in the given domain (e.g. @z-code.com)

and the signature is the same as described for ~#autosign#~.  Note that
~#autosign#~ must also be set in order for ~#autosign2#~ to work.

If a list of addresses is given (terminated by a colon), then all
recipients of the message must match the list of addresses in
autosign2; otherwise, the signature in ~#autosign#~ is used instead.  If
all addresses match but the ~#autosign2#~ signature is empty (no
signature follows the colon), then the message is not signed.
%%

--
autotyper
tty fullscreen gui string
NONE
Program:
Set the autotyper variable to the name of an autotyper 
program. An autotyper program takes the name of a file 
being attached to a message and returns an appropriate 
MIME-type name.
  
Autotyper programs are not provided by default, but the 
following examples are available in $ZMAIL/bin:
  
type-by-magic	Checks that magic number of a file to
                determine its format.
  
type-by-suffix	Checks the suffix of a file's name to
                determine its format. This script does
                not look at a file's contents.
%%

--
cdpath
tty fullscreen gui mswindows string
NONE
Path:
If set to a string of pathnames separated by spaces, this variable is
used in searching for a directory when the ~#cd~cmd#~ command is issued.  The
current directory is always searched before searching directories
listed in ~#cdpath#~.
%%

--
child
tty fullscreen gui string readonly
NULL
When Z-Mail creates a child UNIX process in the background, this
variables holds the process-id (PID) of the child process.
This variable is read-only.
%%

--
cmd_help
tty fullscreen mac gui string permanent
*
Path:
This variable gives the path name of the general ~#help#~ file, which is
read by the ~#help#~ command.  This variable is normally reset only in the
system initialization files, when the default location of the ~#help#~
file has changed.  If an unset is attempted, this variable is
automatically restored to its default value.

The value of this variable is not saved when .zmailrc is
written by the ~#saveopts~cmd#~ command.

%%

--
complete
tty fullscreen gui mswindows boolean string
FALSE \E\CD
Characters:
The first character of the value of complete is used as the
"completion character".  If ~#complete#~ is set, but not to a value,
the escape (ESC) character is used as the default.  Completion is
currently supported only for file names.  The escape character is
treated specially by many GUI mode window managers, so completion may
not operate normally in the GUI mode unless ~#complete#~ is set to
some other character.

The second character of the value of ~#complete#~ is used as the
completion listing character.  When this character is typed, the
possible completions will be printed, and Z-Mail will prompt again
with the original prefix.  This feature is used only in the
command-line interface of Z-Mail.

If ~#complete#~ is set to only a single character, completion listing is
disabled; if it is set with no value, Ctrl-D is used as the default
listing character.  If both the completion and listing characters are
the same, Z-Mail completes if possible and (in the command-line
interface only) produce a listing if the completion is not unique.

Item:
This variable controls what information will be displayed below each
attachment icon in the attachments area of a compose window.  If this
variable is not set, or if none of the other information can be found,
the attachment type is displayed.
%%

--
compose_lines
gui mswindows numeric permanent
NONE 18
Lines:
Sets the initial number of lines in the ~#Compose window#~ 
in GUI mode.
Changing this variable will not affect Compose windows that are
already open, but may change the size of new ~#Compose window#~s.
If this variable appears to be set to 0, then a size specified in
your window system defaults is being used.

This variable was formerly called "msg_win".

NONE 18
Lines:
The number of lines a message must have for ~#pager~var#~ to be invoked.
Used only in the command line and fullscreen interfaces.
%%

--
cwd
tty fullscreen gui mswindows readonly string
Directory:
The current working directory.  Files and folders that do not have
full path names (beginning with a `/', `+', or `~' character) are read
from or written to this directory.

The value of this variable is not saved when .zmailrc is written.
%%

--
date_received
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
When message ~#headers#~ are printed, the dates and times normally shown
are those when the sender sent the messages.  If this variable is set,
then the dates displayed are the dates when the messages were
received.  This also affects date ~#sorting#~ in the line and curses
modes.
%%

--
dead
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string
* ~/dead.letter
Filename:
Names the file to use instead of dead.letter when saving an outgoing
message that has been interrupted or that otherwise fails to be sent.
Your Mail Transport Agent may also save a copy of messages that failed
to deliver.

Also see the variable ~#nosave#~, which allows you to turn off the saving
of dead letters by Z-Mail.  (This would not affect the transport agent.)
%%

--
deletesave
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
Specifies that `saved' messages should be ~#delete#~d when the folder is
~#update~ui#~d.  This is the default behavior in the system mailbox, but in
other folders, `saved' messages are not normally ~#delete#~d.  Messages
that have been preserved with the ~#preserve#~ command are not affected
by ~#deletesave#~.  If both ~#keepsave#~ and ~#deletesave#~ are set, only
~#keepsave#~ is used, so `saved' messages will not be ~#delete#~d.
%%

--
detach_dir
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string
* +detach.dir
Pathname:
The pathname of the directory to use for temporary files when detaching
and displaying ~#attachments#~ of messages you have received.  This path is
used by the "~#detach~cmd#~ -display" command and when displaying ~#attachments#~
from the ~#Message Display window#~ in GUI mode.

Attachment temporary files are deleted when the folder from which they
were detached is ~#update~ui#~d.
%%

--

standard
5
all
Display all headers.
%%
none
Do not display any headers.
%%

Display only headers that have been retained with the "retain" command.
%%
standard
If there are any retained headers, display only those; otherwise, display
all headers that have not been ignored.
%%
unignored
Display only headers that have not been ignored with the "ignore" command.
%%
Condition:
This variable specifies which headers will be displayed when the "display"
command is used to read a message.
%%

--
domain_route
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean string
NONE
Host/Path:
Specifies that addresses containing a fully-qualified domain should be
short-circuited to mail directly to the rightmost fully-qualified
domain.  If set boolean (not to a string), only short-circuiting is
done.  If set to a string, the address is rewritten to UUCP form and
the value of the variable is prepended.  This variable is normally
set by the system administrator if and when it is needed.
%%

--
dot
tty fullscreen boolean
FALSE
NULL
Causes Z-Mail to accept "." on a line by itself to send an outgoing
message.  This is not used in the GUI mode.
%%

--
dot_lock
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
TRUE
NULL
Causes Z-Mail to create a lock file when ~#updating#~ the system mailbox.
This is necessary if your system mail directory is NFS mounted, to
ensure that Z-Mail and other programs such as the mail transport
agent (MTA) are synchronized.

Note: SGI does not support the use of NFS-mounted mail directories.
%%

--
edit_hdrs
tty fullscreen gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
Allow the ~#headers#~ of messages to be edited using your editor.  When
set, the "To:", "Cc:", "Subject:" lines and other ~#headers#~ appear in
the same text area as the body of the message you are composing.
%%

--
editor
tty fullscreen gui string
* vi
Editor:
This variable is only used in GUI mode if the ~#wineditor#~
and ~#visual#~ variables are not set.

The editor variable specifies the editor you prefer to use 
when the editing outgoing messages.  Default is the value of the 
environment string EDITOR or the variable ~#visual#~.  

%%

--
escape
tty fullscreen gui string permanent
~
Character:
The escape character to begin extended editing commands when composing
outgoing messages in the line mode or fullscreen interfaces.
%%

--
exit_saveopts
tty fullscreen gui mswindows mac boolean string
# default values:
true -f -g
Options:
When this variable is set, the saveopts command
is automatically executed when you exit
MediaMail,
so changes you have made to your configuration
are saved to your ~/.zmailrc file.

The saveopts command is executed with the
options specified in this variable.  
By default, the -f and -g options are used,
which means that you will not be prompted to
have the changes saved, and that GUI-specific
settings such as fonts will also be saved for you.

To prevent your changes from being saved automatically, 
unset this variable.

See ~#saveopts~cmd#~ for more information.
%%


--
fetch_timeout
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows numeric
NONE 15
Minutes:
The number of minutes between mail fetches that also call the Z-Script
function 'fetch_mail_hook()'.  The ~#timeout#~ variable is also
respected.
%%

--
fignore
tty fullscreen gui string
NONE
Patterns:
This variable is tested when filename completion is used (see the
variable ~#complete#~ for details).  The value of fignore may be a list
of filename extensions (".c", ".o", etc.), a list of filename patterns
containing metacharacters (*?{}[]), or a mixture of the two.  Each
element in the list must be separated from the others by a space.
When a filename completion occurs, any filenames with the extensions
listed in fignore, or matching the patterns given there, will be
omitted from the completion.
%%

--
filelist_fmt
gui string
# the is_gui? here prevents the ? in the value from being interpreted.
is_gui?%(.?..                [親ディレクトリ]%|%17f %15t  %m/%d/%y   %T %11s%)
Format:
This variable controls the format of the filename entries in the
file finder dialog.  The string may contain formatting characters
to show information about each file.

    %f  the filename
    %t  the file's type, as in "[file]", "[empty]", etc.
    %s  the file's size in bytes
    %m  the month of the file's last-modified date
    %d  the day of the file's last-modified date
    %y  the year of the file's last-modified date
    %T  the time of day of the file's last-modified date
    %%  a literal %

Any of the substitutions may take a width specification in the form of
a number just after the `%'.  For example, "%10f" is a field ten characters
wide which contains the filename.  A string of this form:

    %(f?plain file%)

is replaced with "plain file" if the file is a plain file, and is
removed otherwise.  Also, a string of the form:

    %(f?plain file%|not plain file%)

is replaced with "plain file" if the file is a plain file, or the
string "not plain file" otherwise.  The following conditions can
be used for this construct:

    f   the file is a plain file
    d   the file is a directory
    z   the file is zero size
    .   the file is the directory ".."

A string of this form:

    %n(text%)

(where "n" is a number) specifies that the "text" inside the parentheses
should be filled or truncated to exactly n characters.
%%

--
first_part_primary
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
When this variable is set, Z-Mail interprets the first body part of
any multipart message as the primary body part.  If this primary part
is text-typed or is an embedded message, Z-Mail displays this primary
part as text in the Message Display Window or via the message pager, 
but does NOT display any other body parts in this manner.  In the
graphical user interface, the primary part and all additional parts
appear as icons in the Attachments area of the Message Display window;
to display a part, click on its icon.  In the command-line interface,
the ~#detach~cmd#~ command must be used to display additional parts.

When this variable is NOT set, Z-Mail displays "inline" all text and
embedded message parts smaller than 10 kilobytes in size.  Messages
that have only a single text part are shown inline regardless of the
size of the part.

Note:  Future versions of Z-Mail will recognize standardized message
headers that define the inline behavior of message body parts.  If
such a header is present in a particular message and is recognized
by Z-Mail, this variable will have no effect on that message.

tty fullscreen gui boolean
FALSE
NULL
If this variable is set, Z-Mail ~#update~ui#~s all open folders when its
connection to a terminal (or to the X server in GUI mode) is lost.  As
usual, Z-Mail attempts to load any new mail that has arrived in each
folder before it ~#update~ui#~s that folder.

CAUTION:  In the event of an error, Z-Mail cannot request that the
user confirm any action, because user input is disabled by the loss of
the connection.  It thus is not possible for Z-Mail to guarantee that
~#update~ui#~ on hangup is non-destructive.

If ~#hangup#~ is not set, Z-Mail exits on lost connection and leaves a
temporary copy of each writable folder in the ~#tmpdir#~ directory (in
your home directory if ~#tmpdir#~ is not set).

%%

--
index_dir
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string
* +index.dir
Pathname:
The pathname of the directory where external folder index files are to
be kept.  This path is used by "~#update~cmd#~ -external" (and other commands)
to create the external index file for a folder.

If a complete pathname is not given, the name of the folder directory
(abbreviated as "+" (plus), see the ~#folder~var#~ variable) is prepended.
If index_dir is not set or is an empty string, then the directory
"+index.dir" is used for external index files.  The name of the index
file within the index directory is the same as the name of the folder.
If the index directory and the directory containing the folder are
the same (e.g. index_dir is set to "+") then the index file name is
the folder name with ".ix" appended.  On systems with file name length
limits, the folder name is truncated before appending ".ix".

Index files can be used to save the state of a read-only folder or to
"checkpoint" a writable folder.  An index is created automatically if
you ~#update~ui#~ a folder when you do not have permission to write to the
folder file itself.  For writable folders, an index may be created
within the folder file, so an external index is not normally used.
However, "~#update~cmd#~ -external" may be used to create an external index
as a checkpoint.  See also the ~#index_size#~ variable.

External index files are removed by ~#rmfolder#~ -x foldername", or
when the folder itself is removed by "~#rmfolder#~ foldername", or (for
writable folders only) when all messages have been ~#delete#~d and the
folder is ~#update~ui#~d.
%%

--
index_size
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean numeric
FALSE
Size to Index:
The size (in tens of messages) that a ~#folder#~ must reach before an
index of the folder is automatically created.  For example, a value
of 10 (ten) would cause an index to automatically be created for
any folder of 100 (one hundred) or more messages.  Note that an index is
created only when a folder is ~#update~ui#~d.  If a folder is opened and
closed without ~#update~ui#~, no index will be created regardless of the
folder's size.

Indices speed up opening of large folders by saving, in one place,
the information that would otherwise have to be read separately from
each message.  For smaller folders, however, an index may not be
desired.  Set index_size according to your preference for automatic
index creation.  A value of 0 (zero) or boolean true (set, but no
numeric value) means that all folders should be indexed, regardless
of size.  If index_size is not set, folders are not automatically
indexed.

A folder index may be either internal (stored in the folder along with
the messages) or external (stored in a separate file).  An internal
index is used for writable folders, and an external index for
read-only folders.  See the variable ~#index_dir#~ for details about
external folder index files.  It is possible for a folder to have both
an internal and an external index, in which case the internal index is
used first.  The external index is then referred to for status and
sorting information.

Note that the index of a folder opened in read-only mode (by the
"-readonly" option when starting Z-Mail or when using the "folder"
command) is not normally ~#update~ui#~d.  However, if index_size is set
and the folder is large enough, an external index file is created
when the read-only folder is ~#update~ui#~d or closed, even if the file
already has an index.  An index is created automatically if you
~#update~ui#~ a folder when you do not have permission to write to the
folder file itself.

Indexing is suppressed by "~#update~cmd#~ -noindex" or "~#close~cmd#~ -noindex".
%%

--
intr_level
gui mswindows mac numeric
50
Level:
When commands or other operations take a long time to complete, Z-Mail
sometimes posts a "task meter" that provides feedback about how much of
the job is done.  The task meter also provides the ability to stop some
tasks in progress.  If you start a long, time-consuming process, you
can stop it with a mouse click instead of having to wait for it to
complete.

Rather than having the meter posted for each operation, Z-Mail tries to
choose those operations that "take a long time," so you aren't bothered
by excessive popping up and down of these dialogs.  However, some
computers are faster than others, so it is not always possible to
accurately guess how long a particular task may take.  Furthermore,
people's expectations differ.  Therefore, the value of ~#intr_level#~ can
be set to some value that suits your tastes.  The name indicates that
this is the level at which you wish to be given the opportunity to
interrupt an activity before it completes.

The value is loosely based on the number of messages or size of the
file that will be affected by the task.  A good estimate would be
about 10 messages per intr_level increment.  So, for example, if
intr_level were set to 5 and you were to search for a pattern from a
folder with 50 or more messages, a task meter would pop up and provide
feedback for how much of the task was complete.  If there were less
than 50 messages, the task meter would not pop up.

The task meter may also pop up when ~#opening folders#~ or
~#updating#~ folders.  In this case, Z-Mail's guess is based on the
size of the folder in bytes rather than on the number of messages.

The drawback to the task meter is that performance may drop due to the
frequent redisplaying of the task window.  If you desire a noticeable
increase in speed, you might want to consider turning it off
completely by unsetting intr_level.

in_reply_to
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean string
NONE
String:
This variable may be set to a string that will complete the

defined in the ~#help#~ for hdr_format may be used with in_reply_to.

For example, the default in_reply_to string of
  %f\n\t"%s" (%d)
will create an In-Reply_to: header like the following:

In-Reply-To: johnr@ugl.com (John Raoul)
        "Help with wort pouring" (Oct 2, 1993)

metoo
tty fullscreen gui mswindows mac boolean string

NULL
Normally, copies of messages you send to local mailing lists are not
sent back to you, because most Mail Transport Agents will remove the
message sender's name when forwarding to a mailing list.  Setting
~#metoo#~ will preserve your name on such mailing lists if possible,
so that you will get a copy of your own mail.  When you reply to
mail, Z-Mail will also keep your name on any list of addresses that
it generates when this variable is set.

Z-Mail passes the string value of this variable as an argument to the
Mail Transport Agent when sending mail.  If the string value begins
with a hyphen (e.g., "-m"), Z-Mail separates it from the rest of the

if your MTA insists on generating its own From: and Date: ~#headers#~.
%%
uucp_style
All addresses passed to the MTA should be in UUCP format, host!user.
Set this only if your MTA has trouble with user@host address format.
Note that addresses within the message may appear unchanged, but any
address seen by the MTA will have been converted.
%%
Restrictions:
Impose various restrictions on the way Z-Mail communicates with the
Mail Transport Agent.  Setting picky_mta to true (on) is equivalent
to setting only the "omit_from" field.

When including the body of a message into an outgoing message, a line
following the last line of included text is printed using the string
value of this variable.  See ~#indent_str#~.
%%

--
pre_indent_str
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string

String:
When including the body of a message into an outgoing message, a line
preceding the first line of included text is printed using the string
value of this variable.  See ~#indent_str#~.
%%

--
presign
tty fullscreen gui mswindows string
NONE
String:
When this is set, Z-mail will sign letters whenever a composition is started.
That is, Z-mail will use the values of 
autosign, autosign2, and fortune
to generate a signature for a composition as soon as that composition is
started, instead of waiting for the letter to be sent.

If the address list is empty when a composition is started, the value of
the presign is used as the address list for the purposes of generating
a signature.  For example, if presign contains the address of someone in
autosign2, then the signature file specified in autosign2 is generated
whenever a composition is started with an empty address list.
%%

--
print_cmd
tty fullscreen gui mswindows string
NONE
Program:
This string should describe a command for sending messages to the
hardcopy printer.  If no ~#print_cmd#~ is specified, one of "lpr"
or "lp" is used, depending on your operating system.  The message
to be printed is supplied as the standard input of the command.
The value of ~#print_cmd#~ may be a /bin/sh pipeline.

The string %P in the value of ~#print_cmd#~ is replaced by the name
of the printer (see ~#printer~var#~).  The string %O is replaced by the
option described by ~#printer_opt#~, which includes the name of the
printer (e.g., if %P is "lp", then %O might be "-Plp").  If neither
%O nor %P appears, then the ~#printer~var#~ and ~#printer_opt#~ variables
are ignored and the command is executed unchanged.

If no ~#print_cmd#~ is specified, the command "$ZMLIB/bin/mailp -W80 %O"
is used by default. 
%%

--
printer
tty fullscreen gui mswindows string
*
Printer:
This variable gives the name of the printer to which the Z-Mail
~#lpr#~ command is directed.  This name is normally prefixed with
one of "-P" or "-d" (depending on your operating system) when
passed to the printing program.  If the value of ~#printer~var#~ begins
with a hyphen, then no prefix is added.  See also ~#printer_opt#~.

If ~#printer~var#~ is set to a comma-separated list of names, Z-Mail
will display that list at the time you print a message and request
that you select a printer name.

If ~#printer~var#~ is set to an empty string, Z-Mail will invoke the
printing command with no printer argument.  This normally causes
output to go to the system default printer.
%%

--
printer_opt
tty fullscreen gui mswindows string
NONE
Option:
This string describes the command-line options used to tell your
printing program what printer name to use.  If ~#printer_opt#~ is
not set, the option defaults to "-P" for Berkeley UNIX and "-d"
for all other systems.  The value of ~#printer_opt#~ is ignored if
the printer name begins with a hyphen (see the ~#printer~var#~ variable).

The string "%P" in the value of ~#printer_opt#~ is replaced by the
name of the printer (see ~#printer~var#~).  Otherwise, the printer name
is appended to the option with no intervening space, e.g. if the
value of ~#printer_opt#~ is "-P" and the value of ~#printer~var#~ is "lp",
then the option passed to the printing program is "-Plp".

If ~#printer_opt#~ is set to an empty string, Z-Mail will invoke the
printing command with no printer argument.  This normally causes
output to go to the system default printer.
%%

When this variable is set, addresses in outgoing mail are tested
against file names in the folder directory (
~/Mail
or the value of the
~#folder~var#~ variable).

If the user name in the address matches a file name, then a copy of
the message is stored in that file.  Note that the file must exist
before the message is sent in order for a copy to be recorded.
%%

True if Z-Mail is running in send-only mode with redirected input,
false otherwise.
%%

--
reply_to_hdr
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean string
NONE
Headers:
When replying to mail, Z-Mail generates a return email path to the
sender by examining various message ~#headers#~ in the original message.
By default, the address is taken from the Reply-To: header, the From:
header and the Return-Path: header.  You can override this behavior
by setting the reply_to_hdr variable to specific header names.  For
example,

    set reply_to_hdr = "sender, reply_to, return_path"

If reply_to_hdr is set, but not to a specific value, then the special
header "From " is used.  This may or may not be supported on your
particular system, and is only useful for UUCP sites only.  Ask your
system administrator for more information if you are unsure about
this setting.
%%

Option(s):
This variable may be set in the initialization file to presort mail in
the system mailbox upon entering Z-Mail.  The value of this variable
is the same as the arguments to the ~#sort~cmd#~ command.  For example:

  set sort="-r -d -s"

will sort the system mailbox by reverse-date and subject.

If the variable ~#always_sort#~ is also set, then the system mailbox
will be sorted whenever new mail arrives there.
%%

--
speller
gui string
/usr/bin/spell
Program:
Names a program to be used for ~#spell checking#~ in compositions

When printing the summaries, this variable is evaluated and each
character in the string is duplicated unless a `%' character is
encountered.  `%' introduces an abbreviation for one of the
~#headers#~ of the message.  (This variable was formerly called
"hdr_format".)

    %a  address of the author

--
templates
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows string
NONE
Directories:

Describes the default directories (separated by spaces) where message
~#forms#~ (or ~#templates~ui#~)can be found.  The system administrator
may provide a directory (usually
$ZMLIB/forms
) where prepared forms
are stored.  However, each user can provide forms for his own use by
placing them in the directories described by this variable.

All files located in these directories are expected to be ~#forms#~.
If a file in one of these directories is named "default", Z-Mail
reads that file into every message you compose, unless you specify
a different template.  Note that the ~#templates#~ variable must be
set in order for the "default" template to be used, even if the
"default" template is stored in the system templates directory.

Note that the directories specified by this variable are searched
in reverse order; if you specify the value of templates as:
    
    /usr/fred/templates /usr/jane/templates

and both directories contain a template called "expenses",
the version in /usr/jane/templates will be used.  
%%

--
textpart_charset
tty fullscreen gui mswindows string
iso-2022-jp
Character set:
This variable names the character set that Z-Mail will use by default
when sending text body parts in outgoing messages. (See below for a
list of valid character sets.)  If you generate text message body
parts that use non-ASCII characters (Cyrillic, for example), you
should set this variable to the name of the character set with which
you are composing your body parts.

This variable is normally set by your system administrator.  See the
ISO document 'Information Processing -- 8-bit Single-Byte Coded
Graphic Character Sets' for a complete description of the character
sets listed below.

This variable's contents are not case-sensitive.

The following is a list of valid character sets.  You can specify a
character set in textpart_charset that is not listed here, but you
must precede it with 'X-' to maintain compliance with the ~#MIME#~
specification.

to execute.

You should be extremely careful about modifying the
setting of this variable, and you should take steps
to ensure that functions you add to it cannot be
used to do malicious things.

If this variable is set, you should be using
X authorization to help control access to your

unix
tty fullscreen boolean
FALSE
NULL
When this variable is set, Z-Mail will attempt to execute as a UNIX
program any command that it does not itself recognize.  
In GUI mode, the output of the UNIX command is directed to the ~#Main window#~ 
output text area, and the standard input of the UNIX command is closed.

If a UNIX command is executed in this way from GUI mode, Z-Mail will
wait a few seconds for it to complete.  If the command does not
finish within this time, Z-Mail will display the Task Meter to let
you know that an external command is running.  Press the Stop button
to continue your Z-Mail session.
%%

NULL
Z-Mail passes this verbose flag to the Mail Transport Agent when sending
mail, and will print additional information about the sending process.
In GUI mode, a dialog appears containing the output from the MTA.

If the string value of this variable begins with a hyphen (e.g., -v)
Z-Mail separates it from the rest of the ~#sendmail#~ command with a
space.  If the string value does not begin with a hyphen, no space is
added.  If the string value is empty, a default value is used if one
is known, otherwise verbosity is not enabled.

%%

--
window_shell
gui string
NONE
Program:

This variable specifies a program to use when a tty window
is needed for input or output from Z-Mail and the
~#winterm#~ variable is not set.  It is also used in GUI
mode to create a new tty window for an external editor
(named by ~#visual#~) to run in when the ~#wineditor#~
variable is not set.

Z-Mail starts an external editor in GUI mode by appending
the value of ~#visual#~ (or ~#editor#~ if ~#visual#~ is
undefined) to ~#window_shell#~, then executing the result
as a UNIX command.

If window_shell is unset, Z-Mail will use "xterm -e" by default.  If
you use an external editor that creates its own window, you
should set ~#wineditor#~ to the editor.
%%

--
winterm
gui string
NONE
Program:

Set this variable to the name of the program to run when you
create shell processes in GUI mode.  If the WINTERM environment
variable is set, winterm is set by default to its value.
If winterm is unset, the value of ~#window_shell#~ is used
instead.
%%

--
wineditor
gui string
ieditor
Program:

When you invoke an external editor in
GUI mode, the program specified by wineditor is executed in
favor of the programs specified by either the ~#visual#~ 
or ~#editor#~ variables.

Common settings of this variable include:

     xterm -e vi
     jot -f

Do not specify wineditor in a way that will cause the
external editor to be invoked as a background process.

For example, the jot program is automatically invoked
as a background process unless the -f option is specified.
Therefore, in order to use jot as your external editor
you should set this variable to

     jot -f 

rather than

     jot

If you unset this variable, the value of the WINEDITOR
environment variable is used instead, if it is set.  
If you choose to unset the wineditor variable, you should
be certain that the WINEDITOR environment variable 
is not specified in a way that causes the editor to
be invoked as a background process, as described above.

If the wineditor variable and the WINEDITOR environment
variable are not set, Z-Mail invokes the external editor
in GUI mode by appending the value of the ~#visual#~ variable 
to the value of the ~#window_shell#~ variable and executing
the result as a UNIX command.
%%

--
wrap
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean
FALSE
NULL
Normally, when the last message is deleted, the current message pointer
remains pointing to the last message and the user is done reviewing his
mail.  If this variable is set, the current message pointer will wrap
around to the beginning of the user's messages again to the ~#next#~
undeleted message.  This also applies to the ~#next#~ command.
%%

--
wrapcolumn
tty fullscreen mac gui mswindows boolean numeric gui_max=200
FALSE 72
Column to wrap:
The value of wrapcolumn specifies the length of lines in outgoing
messages.  If wrapcolumn set to no value, a value of 72 is assumed,
indicating that lines will be broken in between words at or before the
seventy-second character on the line.

Line wrapping can be disabled by unsetting wrapcolumn, by setting 
it to zero, or by unsetting ~#autoformat#~ (see below).

You should set wrapcolumn to a value less than 80, since most messages
are read on displays that are 80 columns wide.  A value in the range
of 72 to 78 is considered ideal.

Note that wrapcolumn is used in the Motif, Macintosh, Windows, and Lite
interfaces only when ~#autoformat#~ is also set.  If wrapcolumn has the
value 0 (zero) but ~#autoformat#~ is set, ~#autoformat#~ ignores wrapcolumn
and wraps at the width of the Compose window.
%%
