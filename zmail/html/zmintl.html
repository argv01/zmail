Z-Mail uses XPG3 string catalogs for I18N and L10N.  An XPG3 string catalog is created from a
specially formated source text file by using a facility such as <TT>gencat</TT>, which is the
catalog compiler on IRIX 5+ and on some other platforms that support XPG3.  Other platforms use
a different program name, but the process is similar.  Refer to the documentation for the catalog
compiler you are using for details of generating the shippable run-time string catalogs.
<P>
After the catalogs have been created, the environment variables LANG, LC_MESSAGES, etc. are used
at run-time to identify which local language catalog to use.  Instead of using the original string
constants, Z-Mail retrieves the corresponding string from the compiled catalog and uses that.  If
a given string cannot be found in the catalog, the original constant is used.
<P>
The following are instructions for maintaining the US-English language
string catalog source files and the corresponding C and C++ string constants.

<LI><A NAME="mcat1-1">Strings That Appear Where Function Calls Are Legal</A>
<P>
When a user-visible string appears in a context where a function
call would be legal, wrap that string in the CATGETS() macro
defined in <TT>include/catalog.h</TT>.  Do not edit the file
<TT>lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT> directly.  Instead, do <TT>make catalog</TT>
just before committing (see below).
<P>
Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>puts( "Are you sure?" );</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Becomes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<CODE>puts( CATGETS( "Are you sure?" ) );</CODE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="mcat1-2">Strings That Appear Where Function Calls Are Illegal</A>
<P>
Some user-visible strings may appear in contexts that do not
allow function calls.  Static arrays of user-visible strings are
a common example of this.  In such cases, wrap each string in
the <CODE>CATREF()</CODE> macro defined in <TT>include/catalog.h</TT>.  <CODE>CATREF</CODE>'s are
no longer <CODE>(char *)</CODE>, but rather are of type <CODE>catalog_ref</CODE>, so
adjust your declarations accordingly.  When the string is
actually presented to the user, use macro <CODE>catgetref()</CODE> to convert
it to <CODE>(char *)</CODE>.  Do not edit the file <CODE>lib/locale/C/Catalog</CODE>
directly, but instead <TT>make catalog</TT> just before committing (see
below).
<P>
Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><CODE>static char *choices[] = { "Yes", "No" };
[...]
puts( choices[ i ] );</CODE></PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Becomes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE><CODE>static catalog_ref choices[] = {
    CATREF( "Yes" ),
    CATREF( "No" )
};

<LI><A NAME="mcat2">Changing the English Form of an Already-Catalogued String</A>
<P>
To change the English text of a catalogued string, simply change
the fallback string embedded in the source itself, generally found
within a <CODE>CATGETS()</CODE>, <CODE>CATREF()</CODE>, <CODE>catgets()</CODE>, or <CODE>catref()</CODE> form.  Do not
change or remove any other parameters appearing within that form.
Do not edit the file <TT>lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT> directly, but instead
do <TT>make catalog</TT> just before committing (see below).
<P>
Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>puts( catgets( catalog, CAT_DEMO, 12, "Are you sure?" ) );</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Becomes:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>puts( catgets( catalog, CAT_DEMO, 12, "Surely you jest." ) );</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Remember that whenever you change the English form of a string,
translating bureaus will have to be paid to re-translate that
string into any other languages we support.  Do not take such
changes lightly; make every reasonable effort to get it right the
first time.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="mcat3">Removing Catalogued Strings from the Catalog Source</A>
<P>
To "uncatalog" a string, remove the entire <CODE>CATGETS()</CODE>, <CODE>CATREF()</CODE>,
<CODE>catgets()</CODE>, or <CODE>catref()</CODE> form, and replace it with the string itself.
In the case of <CODE>CATREF()</CODE> and <CODE>catref()</CODE> forms, you will probably need
to change some declaration's type from <CODE>CATALOG_REF</CODE> or <CODE>catalog_ref</CODE>
back to <CODE>(char *)</CODE>.  Do not edit the file <TT>lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT>
directly.  Issuing <TT>make catalog</TT> just before committing is
reasonable, but not strictly necessary.
<P>
Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>static catalog_ref command[] = {
    catref( CAT_DEMO, 1, "save" ),
    catref( CAT_DEMO, 2, "delete" ),
};
[...]
execute( catgetref( command[ i ] ) );</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI><A NAME="mcat4">Adding New Non-Catalogued Strings</A>
<P>
To add a new string that should not be catalogued, do the obvious
and just plunk it right in.  If someone else is likely to think
the string was mistakenly uncatalogued, add a comment.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="mcat5">Updating the Catalog Via <TT>make catalog</TT></A>
<P>
   Issuing <TT>make catalog</TT> in a directory containing internationalized
   sources activates <I><B>Catsup</B>: the Catalog Synchronizer and Updater</I>.
   Catsup attempts to keep the English catalog sources in synch with
   the C sources.  The <CODE>CATGETS</CODE> and <CODE>CATREF</CODE> forms are intended for
   temporary use only.  Catsup rewrites these as <CODE>catgets</CODE> and <CODE>catref</CODE>,
   after assigning message reference id numbers and adding other
   necessary parameters.
<P>
   Catsup issues warnings when catalogued strings have changed or new
   strings have been added; in the future, this may indicate that
   (re)translation is required.  Catsup also displays error messages
   when id number conflicts are found, but it does not attempt to
   repair this type of error.
<P>
   Catsup always rewrites the <TT>Catalog</TT> file; the previous contents
   are saved as <TT>Catalog~</TT>.  Catsup may also rewrite C source files
   that contain <CODE>CATGETS</CODE> or <CODE>CATREF</CODE> forms.  When it does so, the
   previous contents of each file <TT>foo.c</TT> are saved in <TT>foo.c~</TT>.
<P>
Catsup allocates new id numbers in <TT>Catalog</TT> (the file).  <I>If two
people run Catsup, they may each allocate the same id number for
two different strings.</I>  To minimize the risk of such conflicts, you
should <TT>cvs update lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT> soon before <TT>make catalog</TT>,
and <TT>cvs commit lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT> soon after.  Since
you generally update your source tree right before a commit, simply
add a <TT>make catalog</TT> step in the middle.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="mcat6">Creating a Compilable Catalog Source</A>
<P>
Issuing <TT>make zmail.cat</TT> performs all the symbol substitutions on 
Catalog that will turn it into a real, XPG3, <TT>gencat</TT>-able catalog source.
This is the form that should be provided to translators.
<P>
Note that <TT>lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT> is <B>not</B> directly input to <TT>gencat</TT>.
You must first create <TT>zmail.cat</TT> and then feed <TT>zmail.cat</TT> to <TT>gencat</TT>.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="mcat7">Editing the Catalog Source</A>
<P>
In spite of all the admonitions, above, to avoid editing <TT>lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT> directly,
it is sometimes necessary to do so.  Catsup and <TT>make zmail.cat</TT> are not perfect, so it
is a good idea to examine the final catalog source for discrepancies before doing
<TT>make zmail.cat</TT> and sending the result out for translation.
<P>
However, it really <I>is</I> true that you should not edit <TT>zmail.cat</TT>.  If <TT>gencat</TT>
complains about the contents of <TT>zmail.cat</TT>, fix <TT>Catalog</TT> and rerun <TT>make</TT>.
<P>
For a complete description of the catalog format, see the documentation for <TT>gencat</TT> or your
catalog compiler.  For editing <TT>lib/locale/C/Catalog</TT>, the following rules are sufficient:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Never edit lines beginning with a dollar sign (<CODE>$</CODE>).
<LI>The catlog is divided into sets of strings; lines beginning with <CODE>$set</CODE> name
the sets.
<LI>Strings are numbered in <B>increasing</B>, but <B>not</B> necessarily consecutive, order
within each set; the numbers within a set must be <B>unique</B>.
<LI>There <I>must</I> be <B>exactly one tab</B> between the string number and the string.
<LI>Strings are quoted as in C (see the <CODE>$quote</CODE> directive at the top of the file);
strings may be continued across multiple lines by using the C backslash-newline convention.
<LI>Each string appearing in the catalog must be <B>exactly</B> the same as any strings using the
same catalog set and string number in <CODE>catgets()</CODE> or <CODE>catref()</CODE> calls in
the C code.  <I>If you edit the catalog, you must edit the C code to match.</I>
</UL>
<P>
If you are very careful, and follow the above rules closely, you can do <TT>catsup</TT>'s job
manually in the event that you have to change or add a string at the last minute.  Be sure that
any new strings that you add:
<OL>
<LI>are added at the end of the appropriate string set;
<LI>have a larger number than the largest already in the set;
<LI>are properly quoted, and separated from the number by a tab; and
<LI>have a matching <CODE>catgets()</CODE> or <CODE>catref()</CODE> in the C code,
specifying the same set name and string number.

<LI><A NAME="i18n1">Avoiding Grammatical Assumptions</A>
<P>
      When a sentence may require a singular or plural form, use two
      entirely separate strings, rather than tacking an 's' onto the
      end of the appropriate English word.  Pluralization may be
      arbitrarily complex in other languages; you cannot assume that
      it is grammatically correct to simply adding some fixed suffix
      to one noun.
<P>
Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>printf("saved %d message%s\n",
       count,
       (count == 1 ? "" : "s"));</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Becomes:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE><CODE>if (count == 0)
    printf(CATGETS("saved 0 messages\n"));
else if (count == 1)
    printf(CATGETS("saved 1 message\n"));
else
    printf(CATGETS("saved %d messages\n"),
           count);</CODE></PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Generally speaking, you should not make any assumptions about
      grammar or sentence structure.  Changes to one part of a
      sentence or phrase may have essentially arbitrary effects on the
      rest of that string. Languages are convoluted, and what is true
      of English may be dead wrong elsewhere.
<P>
      For example, many Romance languages associate a gender with all
      nouns, and require gender agreement between subjects and verbs.
      If the subject of a sentence can change in different contexts,
      its verb may need to change as well.  Do not assume that you can
      simply drop in different words without changing the rest of the
      sentence as well.

Your challenge as an international coder is to create software that
can be localized to use any human language, having any properties,
anywhere in the world, with zero <I>a priori</I> knowledge about that
language's particular characteristics.  This is not easy, but it can
be done.  The most important things you can do are to think ahead and
to avoid making English-biased assumptions.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="loc1">Anticipating Size and Length Changes</A>
<P>
      Different languages vary widely in how much physical space
      expressions take up.  German, for example, contains many nouns
      that are much longer than their English equivalents.  Japanese,
      on the other hand, may use only one or two glyphs to describe
      the same object.  On the other hand, a single full-width
      Japanese Katakana character will tend to be twice as wide as a
      Roman character in the same size font.
<P>
      This can be a particularly vexing problem for graphical user
      interfaces.  Take full advantage of all available facilities for
      flexibly defining a window or dialog's layout.  Use algorithmic
      geometry manager if you have them.  Don't hardwire a text field
      to be ten characters wide ... ten Japanese characters are twice
      as wide as you think they are.
<P>
      Try to minimize the number of assumptions your code makes about
      the size of fonts, or about the length of words and phrases.
      For example, suppose that translation doubles the length of
      every button label.  Will your buttons stretch?  If so, will
      they still fit on screen?  If they don't stretch, will long
      labels get cut off?
<P>
<LI><A NAME="loc2">Eight-bit Languages</A>
<P>
      Most languages require characters not found in the English-based
      ASCII character set.  Romance languages, in particular, tend to
      require additional special characters and diacritical marks.
      ASCII itself occupies values 0-127; the lower half of an
      eight-bit space.  Most languages that are based upon a Roman
      alphabet simply extend ASCII by defining glyphs for bit patterns
      128-255.  This includes all of the ISO 8859 family of encodings,
      as well as myriad regional and national standards throughout
      Europe and the Middle East.
<P>
      In order to accommodate such encodings, the software you create
      must be ``eight-bit clean''.  That is, it cannot use the eighth
      bit as a scratch space, or assume that it will be off.  The
      eighth bit must be respected and preserved, just as one would
      respect and preserve the seven lower bits.
<P>
      Eight-bit clean software cannot make certain assumptions about
      how bit patterns relate to qualitative properties of characters.
      For example, in Poland, it may not be true that all upper-case
      letters are located between 65 and 90; there may be upper-case
      characters above 127 as well.  And Hebrew letters do not even
      have cases; the very question is meaningless.
<P>
      Instead of ``rolling your own,'' use standard and native
      facilities for querying characters' properties.  If you need to
      know if some byte represents an alphanumeric character, don't
      check for 48-57, 65-90, and 97-122.  That won't cut it for
      eight-bit encodings.  Instead, use the standard C function/macro
      <CODE>isalnum()</CODE>.  On internationally-aware systems, the standards
      require this call to properly adapt to the local language.  You
      can trust it to do the right thing.
<P>
      On the other hand, the classic C string manipulation functions
      generally do <B>not</B> know about local languages.  The <CODE>str*()</CODE>
      functions are mathematical, not linguistic.  All they know about
      is bytes.  For example, <CODE>strcmp()</CODE> orders strings according to the
      numeric value of the bytes it contains.  It knows nothing about
      diacritics or special characters.  If you try to sort French
      strings using <CODE>strcmp()</CODE>, you will end up incorrectly placing
      <CODE>"é"</CODE> (e accent egue) after <CODE>"z"</CODE>.  Using <CODE>strcmp()</CODE> is still safe
      for non-localized strings; it is also safe for establishing
      inequality with no partial ordering.
<P>
      Some systems do provide additional functions that let you
      perform lexical operations on strings.  For example, many Unix
      systems provide <CODE>strcoll()</CODE>, which gives you a linguistic
      collating order on a locally-encoded string.  It knows about
      diacritics; it knows about specials.  This is the thing to use
      when ordering localized strings.
<P>
      The guiding principle for dealing with eight-bit encodings is
      this: any direct numeric or bitwise manipulation of a character
      is probably wrong.  You can usually assume that the lower-half
      will stay ASCII-like, but the upper half could be anything.  Use
      native macros and calls.  Don't do it yourself.  If you cannot
      figure out what the native, locale-sensitive calls are, ask
      someone.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="loc3">Multiple Byte Languages</A>
<P>
      Many languages, particularly Asian ones, require more than 2<SUP>8</SUP>
      integer values to distinguish their glyphs.  There is great variation in
      how encodings for these languages are arranged.  Generally
      speaking, you will be dealing with two broad classes of
      encoding: multibyte and wide character.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="loc3-1">Multibyte Encodings</A>
<P>
 Multibyte encodings use a variable number of bytes to
 represent characters.  For example, all of ASCII may be
 represented as single bytes.  Other characters may appear in
 two bytes, where the first is 128 or greater, and the second
 is 0-127.  Still others may use three bytes, with the first
 two high and the third arbitrary.  This is just an example,
 but it highlights some important caveats when dealing with
 multibyte strings:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Random access to the <CODE>n</CODE>'th character is impossible.  You
     can index down to the <CODE>n</CODE>'th <I>byte</I>, but you cannot know
     how many characters came before this byte, or whether this
     byte is the start of a character or in the middle of
     another one.
<LI>Arbitrary substrings of a string may not be valid
     strings.  You cannot simply split at any byte you choose.
     For all you know, you may be splitting a character right
     in half.
<LI>The only safe way to process a multibyte string is by
     scanning from start to end.  If you hop right into the
     middle, you have no way of knowing where you are.
</UL>
<P>
 Given these limitations, multibyte encodings seem fairly
 unattractive.  In fact, they are extremely common.  With
 multibyte encodings, the payback comes in storage size.
 Multibyte strings take up only as much space as they need.
 In the degenerate case of strings containing only ASCII, most
 multibyte representations use only a single byte per
 character.  For this reason, multibyte encodings are use
 almost universal for transport and persistent storage.
<P>
 Multibyte strings are represented in C code as <CODE>(char *)</CODE>.
 Just remember: those are not characters, they are bytes.  The
 classic C <CODE>str*()</CODE> functions still work, but only on the byte
 level.  They do <I>not</I> change their behavior in different
 locales.  So <CODE>strlen()</CODE> gives you a byte count, not a character
 count.  And <CODE>index()</CODE> hunts for bytes; it doesn't know a thing
 about characters.  You get the picture.
<P>
 All of the caveats about eight-bit encodings apply doubly to
 multibyte encodings.  Almost all of the classic C <CODE>str*()</CODE>
 calls will operate on the byte level; they are mathematical,
 not linguistic.  You can make few, if any, assumptions about
 the qualitative characteristics of a string based upon the
 bit patterns it contains.  Use any locale-sensitive native
 calls where available; ask for advice if you are unsure how
 to proceed.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="loc3-2">Wide Character Encodings</A>
<P>
 Wide character encodings use a fixed number of bytes per
 character.  They are sort of like ASCII scaled up.  <I>Narrow
 Unicode</I>, for example, is an encoding where every single
 character is expressed in 2 bytes.  Some other encodings
 might use 3 per character, or even 4.  You might even think
 of ASCII as a 1-byte-per-character wide encoding.
<P>
 The obvious down side of wide encodings is that they will
 tend to require more space to represent a given string.  The
 up side is that you can randomly access into the string.  As
 long as you stay on fixed, wide character boundaries, you
 know you are safe.
<P>
 In C, a single wide character is represented by <CODE>(wchar_t)</CODE>.  A
 string of wide characters would be <CODE>(wchar_t *)</CODE>, while a
 string of fixed length might be <CODE>(wchar_t [20])</CODE>.  You're
 simply replacing <CODE>(char)</CODE> with <CODE>(wchar_t)</CODE>.  The host system's
 headers will define <CODE>(wchar_t)</CODE> to some suitably wide type.  It
 might be <CODE>(int)</CODE>, or <CODE>(long)</CODE>, for example.  The actual type used
 depends on the possible wide encodings supported by that
 platform.
<P>
 Wide characters are rather easier to deal with than
 multibytes.  Since <CODE>(wchar_t)</CODE> is a completely different type
 from <CODE>(char)</CODE>, you obviously cannot use things like <CODE>strcmp()</CODE> or
 <CODE>getc()</CODE> or <CODE>fputs()</CODE> at all.  If you try, any prototyping
 compiler will smack you for type violations.
<P>
 Instead, systems that support wide characters supply an
 entire second set of manipulators that mimic the classic
 <CODE>(char)</CODE> and <CODE>(char *)</CODE> calls.  Instead of <CODE>strlen()</CODE>, you use
 <CODE>wslen()</CODE>.  Instead of <CODE>strncmp()</CODE>, you use <CODE>wsncmp()</CODE>.  Instead of
 <CODE>gets()</CODE>, you use <CODE>getws()</CODE>.  And so on.
<P>
 Unfortunately, while wide character encodings are much easier
 to manipulate, they are much less commonly used than
 multibyte encodings.  The additional storage space is just
 too unattractive, as is the complete loss of even partial
 ASCII compatibility.  Software that uses wide characters at
 all tends to do so only for internal processing.  You may
 read in a multibyte string as a <CODE>(char *)</CODE>, convert it to wide
 character <CODE>(wchar_t *)</CODE>, modify it in some manner, and then
 convert it back to multibyte before writing it out to disk.
 Systems that support both wide and multibyte encodings will
 usually also provide lossless conversion routines between
 the two.

<LI><A NAME="loc4">Right-To-Left Languages</A>
<P>
Languages like Hebrew and Arabic often require that the entire user interface be reversible, so
that labels can appear on the other side of text fields and so forth.  On terminals that display
from right to left, this frequently works without additional effort, but care may still be
required for cursor addressing and the like.  In X11, the problem is more complicated.
<P>
Motif 1.1 supports ``directional'' text only in labels, not in text widgets.  Motif 1.2 and 2.0
support directional text in the ``compound text'' widget, but not in the base text widgets.
User interface elements usually need to be laid out with <CODE>XmForm</CODE> containers, with at
least the <CODE>leftAttachment</CODE> and <CODE>rightAttachment</CODE> resources settable in the
external resource files (and possibly <CODE>topAttachment</CODE> and <CODE>bottomAttachment</CODE>
resoruces so settable, as well).

<LI>Z-Mail Motif
<P>
Most Motif UI objects size themselves sensibly for the font selected.  Care may need to be taken
in specifying certain labels on the dialogs, but menus and most buttons generally work out fine.
Text widgets and the like automatically adjust to the size of the font they are asked to display,
but editing widths may need to be changed via resources or variable defaults to avoid taking up
too much screen space with wide characters.
<P>
<LI>Z-Mail Lite
<P>
Lite does a very sophisticated job of computing screen geometry for dialog boxes and so forth.
It is not usually necessary to code for string sizes.  However, because of the very limited
screen real estate on a typical terminal, translators must be cautioned to use the shortest
strings possible for user-interface elements such as menu items and function key labels.

<LI><A NAME="loc02">Eight-bit Languages</A>
<P>
Z-Mail in general makes no assumptions about the 8th bit, and uses the <TT>ctype.h</TT> macros
such as <CODE>isalnum()</CODE> and <CODE>isspace()</CODE> to test character properties for most
<I>classes</I> of characters.  <I>Individual</I> characters, particularly space, tab,
carriage-return, and linefeed (newline), are usually checked by direct comparison to a C character
constant (<I>e.g.,</I> <CODE>'\n'</CODE>).  Comparisons to integer values are used only in special
cases; for example, the Mac C compiler reverses the integer values of the constants
<CODE>'\n'</CODE> and <CODE>'\r'</CODE> so the numeric constants <CODE>'\012'</CODE> and
<CODE>'\015'</CODE> are used when the integer value is important (such as in SMTP transactions).
<P>
However, the <CODE>isspace()</CODE> macro on some platforms is broken with respect to characters
with the 8th bit set, so it is necessary to test <CODE>isascii() && isspace()</CODE>.  A macro
<CODE>ISSPACE()</CODE> is provided for this, but may not be used everywhere that it should be.
<P>
Lexical operations on strings do not use <CODE>strcoll()</CODE> at this time.  However, most are
performed using a set of ``case-independent'' string routines, such as <CODE>ci_strcmp()</CODE>,
defined in <CODE>general/strcase.c</CODE> and <CODE>general/strcase.h</CODE> to either map to the
platform's provided routines (<I>e.g.,</I> <CODE>strcasecmp()</CODE> or <CODE>stricmp()</CODE>) or
to implement a bytewise comparison with characters converted to ``lower case'' by <TT>ctype.h</TT>
macros such as <CODE>tolower()</CODE>.  These routines should handle local languages correctly.
<P>
Automatic text wrapping fails on some non-Romance languages because the concept of a ``word'' does
not match Z-Mail's heuristics.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="loc03">Multiple Byte Languages</A>

As of this writing, all Z-Mail products on all platforms use 8-bit characters only, no wide or
multibyte encodings.
<P>
<LI><A NAME="loc04">Right-To-Left Languages</A>
<P>
Z-Mail's support for right-to-left text is tenuous at best.  Lite needs a number of code changes.
Motif needs extensive geometry changes because it does not in general use <CODE>XmForm</CODE> or
permit the
geometry to be changed via resources.  (The layout of the address editing area at the top of the
compose window is an exception, but even that is incompletely configurable for right-to-left style.)
Those platforms built with Motif 1.1 cannot handle editing
of right-to-left text at all (though UI labels can be made to work).
<P>
Automatic text wrapping doesn't work at all for right-to-left strings.
