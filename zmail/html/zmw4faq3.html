   <a name="VA"><b>A. Network Problems</b></a>

      <a name="VA1"><b>1. What is a "Cannot connect to network - WINSOCK not found" error?</b></a>

It is likley that Z-Mail could not process a WSAStartUp call, which can result
from a missing WINSOCK compatible TCP/IP network stack, or from a missing
WINSOCK.DLL file.  Check your PATH to see that your stack is accessable by
Windows applications.

      <a name="VA2"><b>2. Where can I find a WINSOCK-compatible TCP/IP network interface?</b></a>

Z-Mail now ships with one:

	<a href="ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/z-mail/windows/4.0/ncdtcpip.exe">ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/z-mail/windows/4.0/ncdtcpip.exe</a>

      <a name="VA3"><b>3. In UUPC mode Z-Mail complains about WINSOCK.  How can I fix that?</b></a>

This is only true for Z-Mail 3.2x, and not for Z-Mail 4.0.  NCD suggests using
a "dummy WINSOCK" to remedy this.  (see next question)

      <a name="VA4"><b>4. What is a dummy WINSOCK.DLL and where do I find one?</b></a>

The dummy WINSOCK.DLL (stub) is userful for people who will use Z-Mail 3.2x 
in UUPC mode only, without the need to ever hook up to a network.  The file 
WSCKSTUB.DLL should be placed in the C:\WINDOWS directory and renamed to 
WINSOCK.DLL.

It can be found at:

	<a href="ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/z-mail/windows/patch/wsckstub.dll">ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/z-mail/windows/patch/wsckstub.dll</a>

      <a name="VA5"><b>5. Will Z-Mail work with WINSOCK 2.0?</b></a>

Yes.  For more info see: <a href="http://www.intel.com/IAL/winsock2/specs.htm">http://www.intel.com/IAL/winsock2/specs.htm</a>

     <a name="VA6"><b> 6. How can I debug my WINSOCK TCP/IP stack?</b></a>

NCD offers a unique debugging tool for WINSOCK compatible stacks, called
WSASNOOP.  It, and it's instructions for use, can be found at:

ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/z-mail/windows/debug/wsasnoop.zip

   <a name="VB"><b>B. Receiving Email</b></a>

      <a name="VB1"><b>1. What POP-3 servers do you recommend (NFS)?</b></a>

First and foremost NCD recommends Z-POP because of its robust POP-3
capabilities and enhances features for dealing with synchronization, remote
preferences and configuration.  Z-POP is free and can be found at:

<a href="ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/z-pop/current/">ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/z-pop/current</a>

We also recommend the University of Washington's iPOP3d server, which is
currently contained as a subset of the IMAP sources at:

<a href="ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/">ftp://ftp.cac.washington.edu/imap/</a>

      <a name="VB2"><b>2. What is Mailbox Synchronization?</b></a>

Z-Mail synch is a feature of the interaction that is possible between Z-Mail 
for Windows 4.0 and the Z-POP mail server. A better explaination that space 
allows for here are available from both:

<a href="http://www.ncd.com/Z-Code/zproducts/wp-synchronization.html">http://www.ncd.com/Z-Code/zproducts/wp-synchronization.html</a>
<a href="ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/doc/windows/sync.doc">ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/doc/windows/sync.doc</a>

      <a name="VB3"><b>3. Do you support IMAP?</b></a>

IMAP support is planned for future releases of Z-Mail.

      <a name="VB4"><b>4. What alternatives to POP-3 do you support?</b></a>

If you want to install Z-Win on another system and have it work with an
NFS-mounted spool folder all you'll need to do is go through a standard
SETUP and afterward make the following changes:

1. In Z-Mail 4.0 use the Login's Setup dialog to set your Incoming Mail's 
   "Inbox file name:" to the full path and file of your NFS-mounted mail 
   spool: "DRIVE:\PATH\TO\UNIX\SPOOLDIR\FILE"

2. Turn off the "Download new mail when connecting" option in the Login's 
   Setup dialog "Incoming Mail" section.

3. Edit your C:\ZMAIL\USERS\$USER\ZMAIL.RC file to add the entry:

   ###################
   # sets use_pop to 
   # the number zero 
   # for NFS-mounting
   set use_pop=0
   ###################

4. That's it!

      <a name="VB5"><b>5. How do I set up a vacation filter?</b></a>

NCD suggests using host-based vacation filters.  See also:

	<a href="http://www.wsr.ac.at/cgi-bin/man/vacation/1#sect0">http://www.wsr.ac.at/cgi-bin/man/vacation/1#sect0</a>

      <a name="VB6"><b>6. Why does Z-Mail download duplicates of all my email?</b></a>

You can keep your mail on your mail host (not on your PC) if you set the
pop_options variable to the value preserve (not all POP-3 servers support this
functionality).

If you set this variable and still receive duplicate copies of each message,
your POP-3 server does not support the "last" command, used to preserve mail.
Both the University of Washington's iPOP3d Server and Z-Code Software's Z-POP
server support the full POP-3 feature set, including "last".

If you wish, you may disable mail preservation entirely by unsetting the
pop_options variable and removing lines beginning with POP_OPTIONS= from
C:\WINDOWS\ZMAIL.INI and C:\ZMAIL\$USER\$USER.INI.

      <a name="VB7"><b>7. What is a pop_dropcopy ERROR?</b></a>

The Z-POP config file contains a number of directives that should be set by 
your site's system administrator.  In the casee of a pop_dropcopy ERROR the 
SPOOL directive could be pointing to an incorrect location.  It is also 
important to note that Z-POP should be setgid the same as the mail spool 
directory:

% ls -ld /var/mail
drwxrwxr-x   3 root   mail           512 Sep 21 17:10 /var/mail/

% ls -l zpop
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin        24081 Sep 21 16:51 zpop

% chgrp mail zpop
% chmod 2755 zpop
% ls -l zpop
-rwxr-sr-x   1 root    mail        24081 Sep 21 16:51 zpop


      <a name="VB8"><b>8. What is the init_check option for POP-3?</b></a>

The init_check option found in the "pop_options" variable listing is used for 
checking the user's email when starting a Z-Mail session, or when entering 
"connected mode".  This option cannot be set from the variables list, and is 
instead set from the login's setup dialog, under Incoming Mail as the 
"Download new mail when connecting" option.  Turning this off is useful if 
you are using NFS to mount your mail spool, connecting via Z-POP Synch, or 
are just plain interested in getting into Z-Mail a little quicker.

      <a name="VB9"><b>9. Why are my "Quick Check" synch scenerios greyed out?</b></a>

Because synchronization scenarios are potentially destructive or can cause
message duplication, we try to create an environment where things are set up
properly for the user - for example, one does not want generally want to use
POP and Sync simultaneously unless one is really paying attention to what
they're doing.  In the case of Quick Sync, the  scenarios were designed to be
used as a complete set: Check out, get new mail via sync, and check back in.
So, we disabled the Quick Sync options on the menu if get mail via sync is not
enabled (pop_options=use_sync).

All sync scenarios are available through the "other scenarios" menu at all
times.

     <a name="VB10"><b>10. Why does some of my new mail show up out of order after a synch?</b></a>

Z-POP client / server code doesn't request / send messages in order by date.
This results in users sometimes getting new mail out of order.  (The sort
stuff only exists in zmenu_qs_checkout.)  This Z-Script function should be
useful to users who would like to defined sort criteria.  Cut and paste into
your ZMAIL.RC file:

####################
# The following two functions and two interpose commands sort new mail
# delivered via a synchronization scenario according to the value of
# $sort (if set) or by date sent.

function presort() {
    set __sort_count = $(%t)
}

function newsort() {
    # Don't sort empty folder
    if $(%t) == 0
	return 0
    endif

    # Define "new mail" as "folder has more messages than before"
    if $(%t) <= $__sort_count
	return 0
    endif

    if $?sort
	sort $sort
    else
	sort -d
    endif
    if $?newmail_scroll
	:n | redraw
    endif
}

interpose -before zpop_sync presort
interpose -after zpop_sync newsort
####################

     <a name="VB11"><b>11. What is a "pop_stat" error, and how do I get around it?</b></a>

To get around a pop_stat error, which occurs when Z-Mail and Z-POP use
synch to create a temporart maildrop that is so big it tiimes out a serial 
setting, we  recommend bumping the value of the IOTimeoutSeconds (Serial 
Read/Write Timeout (secs) in the Setup UI) from 30 to 60 (or more) seconds.

      <a name="VB12"><b>12. What is a "ZHB2" error?</b></a>

This results when a user is attempting to synchronize mail between Z-Mail and 
an older version of Z-POP (or a generic POP-3 server) that does not support 
this feature.

   <a name="VC"><b>C. Sending Email</b></a>

      <a name="VC1"><b>1. What is a "SMTP error - connection refused"?</b></a>

This can happen when Z-Mail tries to start a SMTP session with a bad PC
hostname, which the SMTP server does not recognize.  Check your login's setup 
screen to verify that your PC hostname is set correctly.  This information 
can be stored in the form "ZMHOST=hostname" in your $USER.INI file.

      <a name="VC2"><b>2. How do I save a copy of my outgoing email?</b></a>

Setting the "record" variable will create a file for copies of your outgoing
email.

      <a name="VC3"><b>3. Do you support UUCP (UUPC)?</b></a>

Not offically.  Z-Mail 4.0 now has asynch serial support, negating the need 
for UUPC/UUCP based mail transfer, though the Z-Script hooks that were used 
in Z-Mail for Windows 3.2x still work in 4.0.  Also, keep in mind that UUPC's 
paradigm requires that only one user access Z-Mail on a given PC, and it 
should not be used in multiple-user configurations.


Installing UUPC/extended on your PC for use with Z-Mail for Windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Obtain the latest release of uupcx from:

         <a href="ftp://ftp.z-code.ncd.com/pub/z-code/unsupported/windows/uupc/">ftp://ftp.z-code.ncd.com/pub/z-code/unsupported/windows/uupc/</a>

To install UUPC/extended on a PC to set up a uucp e-mail connection between
a UNIX host and your PC follow these steps...

        01) Make a directory c:\uupc
        02) Copy the file uupcx12.zip into c:\uupc
        03) Extract with 'pkunzip -d uupcx12.zip'
        04) Add this line to autoexec.bat...
                if exist c:\uupc\uupc-set.bat call c:\uupc\uupc-set.bat
        05) Add c:\uupc\bin to the search path set in autoexec.bat
        06) Change the directory c:\uupc\home\jcole to your e-mail name
        07) Edit the file c:\uupc\systems for your UNIX host connection
        08) Edit c:\uupc\uupc.rc and c:\uupc\home\yourname\uupc.rc
            appropriately for your environment
        09) Edit c:\uupc\uupc-set.bat and change 'jcole' to your e-mail
            name as in 6 and 7 above. Also change the timezone setting
            if you're not on the US West Coast timezone.
        10) Edit c:\uupc\bin\uudial.bat and change the system name
            (after the '-s') to the name of the UNIX system your PC
            connects to for e-mail.

Connecting from your PC to a UNIX Mail Host
-------------------------------------------

The file UUDIAL.BAT is what you run to invoke a connection with your UNIX
uucp host to send e-mail messages you've queued up and receive mail queued 
up for you on the UNIX side. Three things execute when UUDIAL.BAT is run.

The first thing called in UUDIAL.BAT is the UUCICO.EXE program, which
is what connects the PC to the UNIX uucp host and exchanges e-mail and/or
files. The 'r' parameter specifies 'Master' role <you initiate the call>, 
and the 'x' parameter specifies the debugging level <goes to stdout and 
also to c:\uupc\spool\uucico.log>. The 's' parameter specifies the uucp
system to connect to.

After UUCICO.EXE finishes UUXQT.EXE is invoked to deliver mail in the
uupc queue to local uupc mailboxes in C:\UUPC\MAIL.

Lastly a program provided by Z-Code named NEWMAIL.EXE is invoked to
process mail delivered to a uupc mailbox and append it to it's Z-Mail
mailbox counterpart. Newlines in the uupc-delivered mail folder consist
of CRLF pairs, and NEWMAIL converts these to LF's only. As well any
Ctrl-A delimters are stripped. This is necessary as Z-Mail for Windows
parses files in a particular fashion to establish MIME body part 
boundaries, and the CRLF pairs confuse that process.

If you want to invoke UUDIAL.BAT from within Windows you should use the
UUDIAL.PIF (Program Information File) file. You may add this to a Program
Manager group. It will execute in the background in a small DOS window
which can be iconified if you like.

As well UUDIAL.PIF can be invoked from a running Z-Mail for Windows by
invoking the Z-Script command

        sh -iconic UUDIAL.PIF

from either the command line in the main window or by defining a button
to call that command when clicked. In either case the uucp connection will
be executed from within an iconized DOS window which will run in the
background unobtrusively.

Lastly in order to have UUDIAL.PIF called periodically from Z-Mail for
Windows while it is up and running place the following function and
variable definitions in either the global Z-Mail system initialization
file (SYSTEM.RC in the Z-Mail lib directory) or in your personal
Z-Mail initialization file (ZMAIL.RC in your Z-Mail home directory). 
The unit of time specified for 'fetch_timeout' is in minutes. It's
value denotes how often the fetch_mail_hook() function will be called.  The 
use_pop variable can also be set to 0 (zero) and will enable you to check mail
without using POP-3.

function fetch_mail_hook() {
    sh -iconic uudial.pif
}
set fetch_timeout=15
set use_pop=0

Setting up a UUCP account on the UNIX Side
------------------------------------------

On the UNIX host which serves as a mail relay there are basically four
files (on a Sun BSD system) which have to be edited. They are...

        /etc/uucp/Systems       ...when to allow uucp connections
        /etc/uucp/Permissions   ...what to do when connecting
        /etc/passwd             ...account info including password
        /etc/sendmail.cf        ...specify PC as a uucp connection for mail


A few other things you should know
----------------------------------

The O'Reilly & Associates book "Managing UUCP and Usenet" is an excellent 
general reference. Well worth the money. 

The file in the top level uupc directory named HOWTOGET.TXT is from the
original UUPC/extended distribution, and explains where to get the latest
version of UUPC/extended on the Internet and other places. 

This zip'd up version of UUPC/extended 1.12 is provided merely to facilitate
implementation by those who may not be familiar with setting up UUPC from
scratch. I highly encourage anyone interested in getting the original
complete distribution of UUPC/extended to consult HOWTOGET.TXT. Source
code for UUPC/extended is also available in the complete distribution.

      <a name="VC4"><b>4. Do you support PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) for email encryption?</b></a>

Yes.  Several Z-Scripts have been penned by our user community for the Windows
line of products.  NCD Software is also currently working with several vendors
for Z-Script integration with encryption software.  Please discuss the terms
of PGP availability with your NCD sales representative or qualified NCD
reseller.

      <a name="VC5"><b>5. How do I avoid loosing email with bad addresses?</b></a>

To avoid losing mail after mistyping an address and getting an SMTP error,
set picky_mta += precheck.  This option is set by default in Z-Mail 4.0.

   <a name="VD"><b>D. Filtering Email</b></a>

       <a name="VD1"><b>1. How come my autoreply only works on the first filtered message?</b></a>

There is a slight discrepancy in the zmfilter_reply function:  You will need 
to edit the function (located in C:\ZMAIL\LIB\SYSTEM.RC so that it looks 
like this:

	function zmfilter_reply() {
	    foreach m $input 'msg_list - $m ; zmfilter_reply_each $1;'
	}


NOTE: There needs to be a trailing ';' to reset the status for the foreach 
      loop.

<a name="VI"><b>VI. Graphical User Interface</b></a>

   <a name="VIA"><b>A. Where did all my Z-Mail 3.21 buttons go when I upgraded?</b></a>

Most of the buttons seen as defaults in Z-Mail 3.21 are now commented out in
Z-Mail 4.0.  This was done to remove duplication between the Toolbar and the 
Button Panel. All you need top do is edit the C:\ZMAIL\LIB\ZMAILMNU.RC file 
and uncomment the buttons you want.

   <a name="VIB"><b>B. Where did all my Z-Mail 3.21 toolbar items go when I upgraded?</b></a>

These are also commented out in the C:\ZMAIL\LIB\ZMAILMNU.RC file.  This was 
done to remove duplication between the Toolbar and the Button Panel. 

   <a name="VIC"><b>C. How do I use one of my own icons or bitmaps to the toolbar?</b></a>

The default icons use 24x24 bitmaps. If your bitmap is smaller or larger
than 24x24, it will not be centered on the toolbar button. There are four
toolbars.  At the command line or resource file, specify which
toolbar to which you want to add an icon.

button -B MainFrameToolbar
button -B MainChildToolbar
button -B MessageChildToolbar
button -B ComposeChildToolbar

You may not use external bitmaps in the text button panels.  Enter the button
command following the syntax in the online help.  After the '-icon' option,
enter the full path to the ICO or BMP file.  For example:

button -n -name connect	 -label 'Connect/Disconnect' -icon
'c:\zmail\icons\discon.ico'  -on-icon
'c:\zmail\icons\connect.ico' -value '$?connected'

button -n -name create -label 'Create New'  -icon 'c:\zmail\icons\compose.bmp' mail

   <a name="VID"><b>D. Where can I find a listing of Z-Mail for Windows toolbar icons?</b></a>

Note: To change a toolbar icon definition, with the size defined as "medium",
all you need to add is: ADDRBOOK_BMP instead of the full name: MD_ADDRBOOK_BMP.

   <a name="VIE"><b>E. How do I "pinup" my MDI Child windows Z-Mail 4.0?</b></a>

In each MDI Child Toolbar definition in the C:\ZMAIL\LIB\ZMAILMNU.RC there 
are remarked references to the "Pinup" button.  All you need to do is uncomment
these definitions to use the pinup command.  This operation will be enhanced in
future versions of Z-Mail, and is not highly recommended.

   <a name="VIF"><b>F. I have a laptop.  How can I set Z-Mail 4.0 to 640x480?</b></a>

In your C:\ZMAIL\LIB\ZMAILMNU.RC file, uncomment out the line:

#button -n -name laptop -label 'Laptop' -icon laptop_bmp 'laptop'

   <a name="VIG"><b>G. How do I paste addresses into a Z-Mail 4.0 compose "To:" field?</b></a>

Z-Mail for Windows 4.0 uses the standard "Shift+Ins" to paste into all 
editable composition fields.  Z-Mail also supports the standard 
"Crtl+Insert" for copying.

   <a name="VIH"><b>H. How do I start Z-Mail minimized?</b></a>

Z-Mail 4.0 now remembers window states between sessions.  In order to start
 Z-Mail in minimized state each time, add the following function to your
zmail.rc:

 function exit_hook() {
    iconify
 }

This will ensure that you iconify Z-Mail before exiting each session, and
Z-Mail
will remember this state the next time you start the program.

Note:  There is a known bug related to this feature.  When you restore Z-Mail's
window size, space is not distributed correctly within and between panes.

   <a name="VIi"><b>I. How do I bypass the Z-Mail login dialog?</b></a>

Z-Mail 4.0 allows you to bypass the login screen.  Note that you may only
bypass the login screen if you store your user password.  This may be an
unacceptable security risk at some sites.

1) In Z-Mail's installation program, set the toggle that allows users to store
encrypted passwords.

2) In the Z-Mail User Setup dialog, select the store password option from the
User Information pane.

3)  Enter your password in the Login dialog, and click Connect.  Your password
is now encrypted and stored in your $user.ini.  Quit Z-Mail.

4) Hand-edit the [Environment] section of your $user.ini to include the line:
StartOffline=False

5) In program manager, create an icon with the command line:
c:\zmail\zmail16.exe @c:\zmail\users\yourname\yourname.ini

where "c:\zmail\zmail16.exe" is the full path to the Z-Mail executable and
"c:\zmail\users\yourname\yourname.ini" is the full path to your $user.ini file.
Note that there is no space after the @ and the path to the ini file.

6) Double click on the icon you have created.  Z-Mail should not display the
login dialog, but go straight to the Main Summaries window.

   <a name="VIJ"><b>J. How do I save an alias after changing it?</b></a>

After modifying an alias through the alias dialog, remember to click on 
the "Define Alias" button, or the current state will not be saved.

   <a name="VIK"><b>K. Why doesn't Z-Mail remember my printer setup?</b></a>

Z-Mail uses the same printer setup API that other applications, like "Notepad"
use, and therefor it falls into some of that API's limitations.  The most 
common example is the default setup is always reset to whatever the control 
panel is set to, and not the most recent settings within Z-Mail.

   <a name="VIL"><b>L. Can I use the Address Browser offline?</b></a>

Yes.  There is currently an unsupported Offline Address Browser that works 
only with Z-Mail 4.0 and the Z-Mail MAPI.DLL.  It can be found in:

<a href="ftp://ftp.z-code.ncd.com/pub/z-code/unsupported/windows/Visual_Basic/Browser/">ftp://ftp.z-code.ncd.com/pub/z-code/unsupported/windows/Visual_Basic/Browser/</a>

The files in this directory show how to use the MAPIRunScript
function (in the Z-Code MAPI.DLL) in a Visual Basic application.

To use...

	1) Make sure you have a copy of VBRUN100.DLL in the
	   \WINDOWS directory on your PC.

	2) Source the z-script file "EXBROWSE.ZSC" in the
	   $ZMLIB\SYSTEM.RC file on your PC.

	3) Make sure you're running a beta version of Z-Win
	   4.0 (earlier known as 3.3), and that you have the
	   Z-Code MAPI.DLL in the ...\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory
	   on your PC.

The MAPIRunScript function provides a way for an external MAPI-aware
Windows app to pass arbitrary z-script to Z-Win. This is a very 
powerful hook, and the included test application, BROWSER.EXE, created
with Visual Basic v1.0, demonstrates the hook as it might be used
from an external directory service browser program to pass an e-mail
address to Z-Win. 

Since Z-Win can't make use of the address_book hook while in
disconnected mode the VB browser can be used to provide access to a
local flat file directory for Z-Win when in disconnected mode.

A few things to know...

	The BROWSER.EXE file assumes there will be a flat file
	directory named ADDRESS.TXT in the same directory it
	is located in.

	The format for user entries in ADDRESS.TXT is...

		Descriptive info|&&|e-mail address

	This is hard coded but may be changed in the VB source files (which
	are included in the ZIP file). The string |&&| which is embedded in
	a user 'record' corresponds to setting lookup_sep to the same string
	when using the built in Z-Win online browser. This will provide for
	using e-mail addresses which contain spaces (comments).

	Any lines in ADDRESS.TXT which begin with a "#" will be treated as
	comments, and any lines which do not contain the separator string
	"|&&|" will not be considered user record lines. This allows for
	ADDRESS.TXT to be managed by ZPOP central config capability,
	assuming you're willing to keep BROWSER.EXE in $ZMLIB (the browser
	and the address file must be in the same directory).

	One undocumented feature is that if you leave the pattern field blank
	and click the Search button *all* of the valid user entries in
	ADDRESS.TXT will populate the match list box.

   <a name="VIM"><b>M. How can I view uuencoded inclusions in Z-Mail 3.2?</b></a>

If a file has actually been "included" into the message body, as some 
mailers will do, then Z-Mail 3.2 will not treat it as an attachment.  
You will need to Z-Script around this to detach these "inclusions:"

	##############################
	# Place in your zmail.rc file
	#
	# Function to uudecode files
	# included in the body of a
	# mail message, not attached.
	# Requires a dos UUDECODE.EXE
	##############################
	function uudecode_inclusion {
	 compcmd save-to-file c:\temp\ztemp.uue
	 sh uudecode c:\temp\ztemp.uue
	 sh del c:\temp\ztemp.uue
	}
	#
	button -window message UUdecode uudecode_inclusion

<a name="VII"><b>VII. Z-Script, Filters, Functions</b></a>

   <a name="VIIA"><b>A. Where can I learn about Z-Script?</b></a>

Currently, the "Z-Script Cookbook" provides the most definitive guide on the 
in's and out's of Z-Script.  It contains a reference guide for all commands 
and variables on each supported platform, as well as an in-depth tutorial 
on how to get started.

The Z-Script Cookbook can be found at:

	ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/doc/zscript

Z-Mail for Windows / Z-Script References can be found at:

	ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/doc/windows

   <a name="VIIB"><b>B. How can I get Z-Mail to automatically run filters and
      open folders during startup?</b></a>

By utilizing a startup_hook function in your personal C:\ZMAIL\$USER\ZMAIL.RC,
which is the same as $HOME\ZMAIL.RC in 4.0.

  function startup_hook() {
      close #0
      open -filter $mail
      open +folder1
      open -filter +folder2
      folder %
  }

   <a name="VIIC"><b>C. What other automatic "hook" functions are available?</b></a>

Z-Mail 4.0 supports three automatic hook functions:

startup_hook
send_mail_hook
exit_hook

   <a name="VIID"><b>D. What happens to my zmail.rc file when I upgrade?</b></a>

Nothing happens to your old ZMAIL.RC file.  The old $USER directory structure
is maintained during the upgrade, so that the user can edit their custom .RC
files and place them into the new C:\ZMAIL\USERS\$USER directory.

WWWeb searches constantly turn up new, private Z-Mail support pages, though 
I recommend highly the comp.mail.zmail newsgroup for beginning and advanced 
user community support. 

Also, the newsgroups comp.mail.mime and comp.mail.zmail are archived
at NCD and will be maintained as a public service to the electronic
messaging community.

	<a href="ftp://ftp.z-code.com/pub/usenet/comp.mail.mime">ftp://ftp.z-code.com/pub/usenet/comp.mail.mime</a>
	<a href="ftp://ftp.z-code.com/pub/usenet/comp.mail.zmail">ftp://ftp.z-code.com/pub/usenet/comp.mail.zmail</a>

The first of these is a large collection of messages posted to
comp.mail.mime, it has well over six thousand articles dating
back as far as December of 1992, although there may still be some
gaps.

The second archive is a complete collection of messages posted to
comp.mail.zmail.  This archive is much smaller, since that group is
much younger, but it should contain every article posted to the group
since the day it was born.

New articles are merged into the existing archives daily.  Articles
are archived three ways in three directories:

    number/

        This directory holds every article in the archive.  Each
        article appears in its own sequentially-numbered file.  The
        entire directory looks like one huge MH-format mail folder.
        The oldest article is named "1", followed by "2", "3", and so
        on.

    month/

        This directory holds one small archive for each month and year
        of the newsgroup.  Each monthly archive is in its own
        subdirectory, named using a pattern of "yymm".  So all
        articles from January, 1995 would be found in the directory
        named "month/9501/".

        Within each month's subdirectory, each article appears in an
        individual file whose name is a number.  The numbers will not
        be strictly sequential though -- rather, they will match up
        with the same numbers used in the "number/" directory.  So if
        a grand total of six thousand articles had been archived by
        the end of one month, the next month's archive will start with
        an article named "6001".

        You can also download an entire month's worth of articles at
        once, as a tar archive.  Just add ".tar" to the end of any
        subdirectory name, such as "month/9501.tar", and get that as
        though it were a file.  The entire contents of that directory
        will be streamed to you as a single tar archive.  You can also
        use ".tar.Z" or ".tar.gz" to speed things up if you have
        decompression tools.

    subject/

        This directory is also split into subdirectories, each with
        its own small archive.  Here, articles are grouped by subject.
        The name of each subdirectory is the same as the subjects of
        all the articles in that directory.  Again, the individual
        articles are named using the same numbers found in the
        "number/" directory.

        For example, if article number/23 has the subject:

            MIME and Z-Mail

        And if number/27 was a followup, with the subject:

            Re: MIME and Z-Mail

        The archiver will clean off the "Re:", and those two articles
        will also be found as:

            subject/MIME and Z-Mail/23
            subject/MIME and Z-Mail/27

        Again, you can also download an entire subject's worth of
        articles at once, as a tar archive.  Just add ".tar",
        ".tar.Z", or ".tar.gz" to the end of any subdirectory name,
        and get that as though it were a file.  The entire contents of
        that directory will be streamed to you as a single tar
        archive.
