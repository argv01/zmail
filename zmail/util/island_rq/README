Dan and Bart,

In this directory you will find two subdirectories, lib and src.
lib contains the sources and (currently) Sparc versions of the
ipc and mem libraries needed to use our IPC mechanism.  Each of
the lib subdirectories (ipc and mem) in turn contains the necessary
includes to build the libraries, and to reference when building the
island_rq program.

The src directory at the top level contains a modified version of
your island_rq program, plus a simple how_to_make script to build
everything you need.

There were a few changes that needed to be made to your source code.
Primarily, the function of yours that gets called when your edit
graphic request is completed (called IpcEditApplyFunc in island_rq) now
takes two arguments:  the first is the original file you started the
edit graphic request with; the second is a temporary file with the
actual data.  We found this necessary to combat the case where a user
fired up multiple edit graphics without saving between them.  Note that
the original file will probably be 0-length -- it serves merely as a
placeholder after the original request.

Another change was to increase the size of the iargv array passed
in to the IOSRequestEditGraphic routine.  We fill in the first four
(and possibly) five entries in the ipc library, so we need to have
space for this.  If you are passing the command line argv to us, you
will have problems.  You must allocate an array to hold your argv
arguments PLUS room for four (or five) more and pass this instead
(after filling in the args with your argv args).

The possibly fifth arg has to do with licensing.  You'll also notice
that there is one more argument to IOSInitIpc.  This should be 1 or
0 depending on whether you're licensed or not.  If you pass in a 0,
any program fired up will not be licensed.  If you pass in a 1, any
edit graphic replies from unlicensed programs will be denied (other-
wise, this would be a way to save from unlicensed versions of our
products which handle edit graphics).

So, to recap the differences:

1. IOSInitIpc takes another argument to indicate licensing status.
2. IOSRequestEditGraphic needs an argv array large enough to hold
	four (or five) extra args.
3. Your IpcEditApplyFunc func receives two filenames -- the original
	(which probably will be empty) and a temporary with the
	actual edited data.

Let me know if you have any problems,
Ken
