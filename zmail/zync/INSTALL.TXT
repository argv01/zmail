Important:

Installation instructions detailed in this document are based  on
installing Z-POP on a Silicon Graphics computer running IRIX. The
installation process on other UNIX variants may differ  slightly.
These differences have been noted in the appropriate sections.

These are only basic steps required  to  install  Z-POP  as  your
POP-3  server  and  enable  Z-POP  services.  For  more  detailed
information  about  each  of these steps, refer to the CONFIG.TXT
file included in the tar file.

1.  Unpack Z-POP from its tar file, which requires:

      - Logging in as root on the host where you are installing
        Z-POP.

      - Changing your current working directory to:

               /usr/local/etc

      - Using tar to extract Z-POP's installation files from the
        Z-POP tar file:

               zcat zpop10-irix.tar.Z | tar xvf -

    This creates the directory /usr/local/etc/zpoplib.

2.  Change your working directory to /usr/local/etc/zpoplib and edit
    the file zpop.config to configure Z-POP's POP-3 defaults, Z-POP
    services, and Z-POP logs.

3.  Provide configuration files for Z-POP's Configuration
    Download service, if you'd like to enable it.

4.  Ensure the same group that owns the mail spool directory owns
    zpop, and that zpop has permissions set to 2755.  On most
    systems you can use these two commands:

        chgrp mail zpop
        chmod 2755 zpop

5.  Add an entry for port 15232 to the system configuration file
    /etc/services.

        zpop        15232/tcp

6.  Add the following line to the system configuration file
    /etc/inetd.conf.  On some systems the inetd.conf file may
    reside in /usr/etc, or have a different name such as
    /etc/servers.

        zpop stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/etc/zpoplib/zpop zpop

7.  If desired, you can replace your existing POP-3 server with
    zpop.  Add this line to /etc/services, if necessary:

        pop-3       110/tcp

    Add or modify this line in /etc/inetd.conf:

        pop-3 stream tcp nowait root /usr/local/etc/zpoplib/zpop zpop

8.  Now you must re-start the inetd daemon to activate your new
    Z-POP server.  Determine the process ID of inetd and enter the
    following command:

               kill -HUP <process-id>
