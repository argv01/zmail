# "cmd" is used to set command line aliases similar to the way "csh"
# does it.  The only difference is that "alias" is a reserved word in
# Z-Mail and Mail, so cmd is used.
#
cmd dq 'd \!*; q'		# Delete a message list, then quit.
cmd unread 'flags \!* U O'	# Mark messages unread.
cmd : fullscreen		# Colon now "toggles" fullscreen mode.
