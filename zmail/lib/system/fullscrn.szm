# The fullscreen mode allows the screen to be set up like a full screen editor.
# There are "fullscreen commands" which are bound to keyboard key-sequences
# (usually one character).  The user can rebind these keys to suit his tastes.
# Note that the binding for R below removes the binding of reply-all.
#
set fullscreen_help	# Unset this to remove help message in fullscreen.
bind \n display		# Hit return to display the next message.
bind e macro "[line-mode]edit\n"	# Quick edit from fullscreen.
bind P macro "[line-mode]Print\n"	# Show me all the headers.
