#! /usr/local/bin/zmail -Nn!S!F!

# USAGE:
#	mh2zm -f input-mh-folder output-zmail-folder
#
# where input-mh-folder is a directory and output-zmail-folder is the
# intended destination file.
#
# OR (if the above doesn't work because your kernel can't understand 1st line):
#	zmail -N -n! -S! -F! mh2zm -f input-mh-folder output-zmail-folder
#
# OR (for interactive use):
#	zmail -F! mh2zm

# Meaning of -Nn!S!F! is:
#	N	Don't show headers of folder when loaded
#	n!	Read neither .zmailrc nor system.zmailrc
#	S!	Force shell mode; arguments are NOT email addresses
#	F!	Read commands from this file and then exit

# If the initial open failed, give up now.
