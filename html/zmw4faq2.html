<a name="I"><b>I. Internet Mail Basics</b></a>

   <a name="IA"><b>A. What do I need to send and receive email?</b></a>

Whether you are using the Internet from a University or inside a corporation
using a departmental LAN, you still need three items to send email.  The first
two components consist of a Mail User Agent (MUA), which is the client that you
use to compose and send, as well as read your email, along with the Mail
Transport Agents (MTA) which handle the delivery of your message.  The third
component is the delivery protocol, which determines how your message is
formatted and delivered.

   <a name="IB"><b>B. What is a Mail User Agent?</b></a>

The Mail User Agent (MUA) is the software you use at your desk, or on a shared
computer, to read, send, filter, and sort your email.  Z-Mail for Windows is a
MUA in that it handles everything but the actual delivery of a message to the
receipient.

   <a name="IC"><b>C. What is MIME?</b></a>

Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) include support for sending binary
attachments from one user to another.  They define the way a .gif image, for
example, is encoded and attached to an email message so that the receiving 
party can detach and decode the image and successfully view it.  Z-Mail 
supports MIME on all platforms, including Windows.

<a name="II"><b>II. Z-Mail for Windows</b></a>

   <a name="IIA"><b>A. What is the most current version?</b></a>

Z-Mail 3.21 has just recently been replaced by Z-Mail 4.0.00

   <a name="IIB"><b>B. What system requirements must I fullfill?</b></a>

Z-Mail 3.21:
	4MB RAM (8MB RAM recommended)
	4MB free space on your hard drive
	MS-Windows 3.1 or newer
	win32s subsystem (INCLUDED)
	VGA display
	80386DX or better CPU
	WINSOCK TCP-IP networking (LAN-based, PPP, SLIP, UUPCX)
	POP-3 and SMTP servers

Z-Mail 4.0:
	4MB RAM (8MB RAM recommended)
	4MB free space on your hard drive
	MS-Windows 3.1 or newer
	VGA display
	80386DX or better CPU
	WINSOCK TCP-IP networking (INCLUDED  - not necessary with serial)
	POP-3 and SMTP servers

      <a name="IIB1"><b>1. What do I need to use Z-Mail from a LAN?</b></a>

You will need a WINSOCK 1.1 compatible TCP/IP network interface running on the
local PC.  Z-Mail for Windows 4.0 actually ships with one, the "NCD TCP/IP
Stack", which can optionally be installed before or after setup.  If you are 
on a LAN you will also need an account on a POP-3 server (usually a UNIX or 
Windows NT box) from where you can retrieve your mail.  You will also need 
access to a similiar machine running SMTP.

      <a name="IIB2"><b>2. What do I need to use Z-Mail over a serial line?</b></a>

Z-Mail for Windows 4.0 has the ability to upload and download mail directly
over a serial line, without a TCP/IP network interface (though PPP and SLIP 
are generally recommended).  For this you will need a Hayes-compatible modem 
that supports error-correcting.  Speeds up to 28.8k with compression are 
fully supported.

You will also need an account on a POP-3 server (usually a UNIX or Windows NT 
box) from where you can retrieve your mail.  You will also need access to a 
similiar machine running SMTP.

   <a name="IIC"><b>C. What is win32s?</b></a>

Win32s is a subsystem designed by Microsoft for the Windows 3.1x and Windows
for Workgroups 3.1x 16-bit operating systems. The Win32s libraries allow
Win3.1x and WfW 3.1x users to run Win32 (32-bit) applications on their 16-bit
operating systems. Windows NT and Win95 are 32-bit operating systems with
Win32s and OLE support built into the operating system. Users of Windows NT and
Win95 should NOT install Win32s on their systems.

NOTE: Win32s is not required by Z-Mail for Windows 4.0.

   <a name="IID"><b>D. What versions of Microsoft Windows are supported by Z-Mail?</b></a>

Windows 3.1x
Windows for Workgroups 3.11
Windows NT 3.5x*
Windows 95*

*Although Z-Mail is not yet a 32-bit NT/95 application, the current
 16-bit version runs and is supported on these operating systems.

   <a name="IIE"><b>E. Why is Z-Mail 4.0 a 16-bit program?</b></a>

Four good reasons:

Performance - On 16-bit versions of Windows Z-Mail 16 will outperform Z-Mail
32. Also, it gives us the ability to run with virtually no performance
penalties on 32-bitWindows versions, such as NT or '95.

Support - A significant number of our support requests are related to
configuration of Win32s - driver version conflicts, high memory problems, and
so on.

Stability - Win32s running on Windows 3.1x is subject to a wide variety of
system configuration problems, making it harder to keep running as users add
software, hardware, and so on.

Broader supported platform range - A win16 version allows us to not only run
on standard windows hardware, but also on things like SoftWindows, Wabi, OS/2,
PowerPC NT (non-native) and so on, all of which have problems (to varying
degrees) with 32-bit windows applications.

NCD does NOT endorse or support any particular viewer.  These products 
are listed here as convenience to our users.  They can be found at <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/SDG/Software/WinMosaic/viewers.htm">NCSA</a>, 
which is an excellent repository of viewers, though you will not need to 
modify any "Preferences" as they describe.  Z-Mail will take it's MIME viewer 
mappings from the "[extensions]" section of the C:\WINDOWS\WIN.INI file.  
Alternatively these can be set up from within the File Manager's "Associate" 
dialog.

<a name="III"><b>III. Installation of Z-Mail for Windows</b></a>

   <a name="IIIA"><b>A. What do I need to do to insure a "clean install?"</b></a>

A clean install involves removing all previous traces of Z-Mail from your 
install drive.  This would include the C:\WINDOWS\ZMAIL.INI and 
C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\MAPI.DLL files as well as the entire C:\ZMAIL tree.  
Z-Mail 4.0 for Windows does not require a clean upgrade, however, as it will 
utilize the defaults from earlier Z-Mail 3.2x C:\WINDOWS\ZMAIL.INI entries.

   <a name="IIIB"><b>B. What if I already had a copy of Z-Mail installed?</b></a>

Z-Mail 4.0 for Windows should be able to utilize some of the existing
information (SMTPHOST, MAILHOST, address_book, etc.) as defaults for a new
install.  With Z-Mail 3.21 a clean install is often the best idea.

   <a name="IIIC"><b>C. I don't know what machines and ports POP-3 and SMTP
      services are installed on.  How do I find out?</b></a>

If there are no system administrators (sysdaddys) around to ask, then you
should start testing TCP services by opening up a terminal connection to the
UNIX host you currently read your mail on.  After logging in, try to open up
ports 25, 110, 15213, and 15232, respectively.

Port 25: SMTP

	% telnet localhost 25
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	220-localhost Sendmail 8.6.11/8.6.9 ready at Thu, 17 Aug 1995
	220 ESMTP spoken here

Port 110: POP-3 (or) Z-POP

	% telnet localhost 110
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	+OK localhost POP3 3.3(19) w/IMAP2 client

Port 15213: Z-Mail Directory Services

	% telnet localhost 15213
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.

		*** This is a special case. Please refer to the
		dirserv.d install instructions for testing
		the directory services daemon. ***

Port 15232: Z-POP

	% telnet localhost 15232
	Trying 127.0.0.1...
	Connected to localhost.
	Escape character is '^]'.
	+OK Welcome to Z-Mail ZPOP server  v.79dev (19sep94)


   <a name="IIID"><b>D. What is Z-POP and how do I find out if I have it?</b></a>

Z-Mail for Windows is designed for use in an environment where mail is
delivered to a mail server and then downloaded to a PC via POP (Post Office 
Protocol).  POP3 is a version of this protocol that has many freely available 
implementations. Z-POP is an enhanced version of POP3 that provides additional
functionality, and is available free of charge from NCD Software.

Typically Z-POP is installed on TCP service ports 15232 and 110 of your UNIX 
Mailhost.  See the above example for testing for TCP services.

   <a name="IIIE"><b>E. Why does Z-Mail complain about my License Key?</b></a>

If you entered your license key incorrectly, or it was a demo key that has
expired, you should expect to see Z-Mail complain about the license.  Your
license key must be 16 alphanumerics, with all letters in lowercase format.  
To add a new demo key in version 3.21, you must edit the "license key" 
entry in the C:\ZMAIL\LIB\SYSTEM.RC file , and the "ZMKEY" entry in the
C:\WINDOWS\ZMAIL.INI.  If you are entering a new key into Z-Mail 4.0 a nifty 
trick is to delete the text to the right of the 'LicenseInfo=' entry in the 
C:\WINDOWS\ZMAIL.INI file.  When you restart Z-Mail it will then prompt you 
for a new key!

   <a name="IIIF"><b>F. Z-Mail 3.21 informed me that I already had win32s,
      so I didn't install the copy you provided.</b></a>

This is a bug in the Z-Mail 3.2x install script.  Ignore these warnings and 
reinstall  Z-Mail 3.21 with win32s enabled.  Remember, however, that WindowsNT
and Win95 should not have Win32s installed onto them from Z-Mail 3.21.  NOTE: 
Z-Mail 4.0 is a "normal" 16-bit Windows application and is not subject to 
these problems.

      <a name="IIIF1"><b>1. When I run Z-Mail it crashes instantly!  What could it be?</b></a>

This is probably due to a faulty installation of win32s.  Try reinstalling
Z-Mail with the "Install Win32s" option enabled, then ignore any warnings while
Z-Mail 3.21 installs.

     <a name="IIIF2"><b> 2. What is a GROWSTUB error in my POINTER.DLL?</b></a>

When you start a Win32-based application using Win32s under Windows 3.1
or 3.11 or Windows for Workgroups, you may receive a general protection (GPF)
fault in POINTER.DLL caused by the Microsoft Mouse driver 9.01 GROWSTUB
component. Microsoft has corrected this problem, so all you need to do is
download HD1061.EXE and replace the POINTER.DLL file.

HD1061.EXE can be found at: ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/HD1061.EXE

   <a name="IIIG"><b>G. Do I want my users to be able to save their passwords?</b></a>

This option is enabled only during installation time.  Passwords are saved as 
encrypted text, and therefore will be difficult to decipher.  This level of 
security is left up to the local sysadmin. NOTE: if the $USER.INI file is 
located on a personal network mapped drive, then security should not even be 
an issue.

  <a name="IIIH"><b> H. What is my PC's hostname?</b></a>

Check with your sysdaddy or within the configuration options of your Winsock
TCP/IP network suite to find your PC hostname.

   <a name="IIIi"><b>I. How do I install Z-Mail on a network?</b></a>

     <a name="IIIi1"><b> 1. How do I install to a shared drive?</b></a>

--------- Z-Mail for Windows 3.21 SHARED NETWORK INSTALL ---------

For the sake of illustration, Z-Mail binaries and library files are
installed on a network server that is mapped as drive W:\ZMAIL as it appears
to the users.  The users' local directories and files are on drive C:.


NETWORK DRIVE STRUCTURE:

W:\ZMAIL		 <- ZMAIL.INI (ZMROOT=w:\zmail)
|   DIRSERV.TXT
|   RELEASE.TXT
|   ZYNC.TXT
|   ZMAIL.EXE
|
+---LIB 		 <- ZMAIL.INI (ZMLIB=w:\zmail\lib)
|   |	ATTACH.TYP
|   |	SYSTEM.RC
|   |	LOCALE.RC
|   |	VARIABLE
|   |	ZMAILMNU.RC
|   |	ZMUI.HLP
|   |
|   \---FORMS
|	    BUGS
|	    PHONE
|			    (all <private>.INI variables point to C:)
+---USER-1		 <- USER-1.INI (HOME=c:\zmail\user-1)
|	USER-1.INI	 <- USER-1.INI (USER=USER-1)
|
+---USER-2		 <- USER-2.INI (HOME=c:\zmail\user-2)
|	USER-2.INI	 <- USER-2.INI (USER=USER-2)
|
etc.


LOCAL DRIVE STRUCTURE:

C:\ZMAIL
|
+---USER-1
|   |	SIGNATUR.TXT
|   |	ZMAIL.RC
|   |
|   \---MAIL
|	|   MAILBOX
|	|
|	\---DETACH.DIR
|
+---USER-2
|   |	SIGNATUR.TXT
|   |	ZMAIL.RC
|   |
|   \---MAIL
|	|   MAILBOX
|	|
|	\---DETACH.DIR
|
etc.


ZMAIL.INI:

[Environment]
ADDRESS_BOOK=zerex:72722   <- hostname:port of directory services (optional)
MAILHOST=zen		   <- hostname of server running POP3
;MAILHOST=zaibatsu:15232   <- hostname:port of server running Zync (optional)
SMTPHOST=z-code 	   <- hostname of server running sendmail
TZ=PST8PDT
USER=USER-1		   <- username (omit if multiple users)
ZCNLSERV=zyrcon:2721	   <- hostname:port of server running NLS (optional)
ZMHOST=zymurgy		   <- hostname of PC running Z-Mail
ZMLIB=w:\zmail\lib	   <- points to LIB directory (see tree above)
ZMROOT=w:\zmail 	   <- points to top-level ZMAIL directory (above)


<private>.INI:

Each user has a directory that contains their personal settings, as well as
any settings that override the system settings as established in ZMAIL.INI.
The name of the directory and the $USER.INI file within it is the user's logon
ID, such as BONNIES for Bonnie Smith.  It must be no more than 8 characters
in length, in order to follow DOS file naming conventions.

[Environment]
FOLDER=c:\zmail\user-one\mail	       <- points to directory
HOME=c:\zmail\user-one		       <- points to directory
MAIL=c:\zmail\user-one\mail\mailbox    <- points to file (default mailbox)
REALNAME=Wazmo X. Nariz 	       <- USER-1's real name
TMPDIR=d:\tmp			       <- directory for temporary files
USER=user-one			       <- user's logon ID

;if using POP3 to receive mail, ignore these next two settings

;ZYNCHOST=zaibatsu:1523 	       <- host:port of server running Zync
;ZYNC_OPTIONS=prefs,config,realname    <- Zync options


--------- Z-Mail for Windows 4.0 SHARED NETWORK INSTALL ---------

A Z-Mail 4.0 Shared installation allows an Administrator to specify default 
locations for user files.  NOTE: The Administrator _must_ have write access 
to the locations where the Z-Mail files are to installes, and if Windows is 
running from a network drive, then the Admin must also have write rights to 
the \WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.  NOTE: it is advisable to consistently map a 
Personal drive (usually P:\ or H:\) for your users, and have them use that 
as a default Z-Mail $USER location.  This provides for easier LAN management 
and security.

Z-Mail's shared installation installs Z-Mail on a shared drive you
choose during the installation. While installing Z-Mail to a shared
drive, you can provide system defaults for your users, such as
SMTP host name and port number.

Before attempting to install Z-Mail on a shared drive:

It is recommended that your users have only read access to the
directory where you are installing a shared copy of Z-Mail.

If your users have write access to the shared directory, they can
overwrite the ZMAIL.INI file, which is where you provided system
defaults for all your users.

After you've completed your Z-Mail installation to a shared drive,
your users must run the installation from the shared drive on
their local PCs in order to create necessary configuration files
and the Z-Mail Program Manager group and icon.

To begin a shared installation, from your temporary installation
directory, use Program Manager to run SETUP.EXE with the shared option:

SETUP.EXE SHARED

Each user will then only need to run the SETUP.EXE program without any options.

      <a name="IIIi2"><b>2. What is a "NETCOPY" install?</b></a>

A Z-Mail for Windows 4.0 netcopy installation does not actually install Z-Mail.
A netcopy installation enables you to provide a zmail.ini file that contains
system defaults your users see when they install Z-Mail from the
network drive or from two distribution disks.

Before starting a netcopy installation:

If you intend to distribute the Z-Mail installation program on
floppy disks, and you do not have DISK1 and DISK2 subdirectories
in your temporary installation directory, you must unpack the
archive ZWIN40.EXE again by running the following command in
Program Manager:

ZWIN40.EXE -d

This maintains a directory structure that makes copying to disks
easy.

To begin a netcopy installation, from your temporary installation
directory, use Program Manager to run SETUP.EXE with the
netcopy option:

SETUP.EXE NETCOPY

Make sure that you spell NETCOPY correctly, also.  Z-Mail will not warn you
about mispellings if you make a mistake.

<a name="IV"><b>IV. User Maintence</b></a>

  <a name="IVA"><b> A. How do I add / remove users with Z-Mail 3.21?</b></a>

To add users with Z-Mail 3.21 you will need to first remove the "USER=" field
in the C:\WINDOWS\ZMAIL.INI file.  Then create a directory structure under
C:\ZMAIL based on the username of your new user.  Copy the .INI files from your
original C:\ZMAIL\$USER directory to the new location, and edit all folder
references so that they point to the corrrect locations in the new tree.

   <a name="IVB"><b>B. How do I add or remove users with Z-Mail 4.0?</b></a>

For existing users from an upgrade all you need to do is "Browse" for theit 
$USER.INI from the Login screen, after entering their $USERNAME and hitting 
[enter].  If the user exists on a network drive, and is accessing his account 
on several machines, note that the drives must be mapped the same on all
involved machines.

Alternatively, a new user can be added just by entering the new username at 
the Login Screen, hitting [enter], and choosing New.  Just start a new user 
profile.

  <a name="IVC"><b> C. How do I change a user's POP-3 server, or SMTP host?</b></a>

Z-Mail 3.21

These settings can be changed by modifying the values in the MAILHOST and 
SMTPHOST entries in the C:\ZMAIL\$USER\$USER.INI file.

Z-Mail 4.0

Adjust the POP-3 server and SMTP server entries in the Setup dialog from the 
Login Screen.
