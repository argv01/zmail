<a name="I"><b>I. Z-POP Mail Server</b></a>

   <a name="IA"><b>A. Installation</b></a>

     <a name="IA1"><b>1. How do I make Z-POP function as my POP-3 server?</b></a>

To Install Z-POP as a POP-3 Server:

    * Obtain the tar file and extract the files from it.  NOTE: this
      may not be the actual name of the zpop file.

	% cd /usr/local/etc
	% zcat zpop.tar.Z | tar xvf 

    * Also, it is also important to note that Z-POP should be setgid
      the same as the mail spool directory:

	% ls -ld /usr/spool/mail
	 drwxrwxr-x   3 root    mail       512 Sep 21 17:10 /usr/spool/mail/
	% ls -l zpop
	 -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin     24081 Sep 21 16:51 zpop
	% chgrp mail zpop
	% chmod 2755 zpop
	% ls -l zpop
	 -rwxr-sr-x   1 root    mail     24081 Sep 21 16:51 zpop

    * Edit Unix system files and the zpop.config
      configuration file.

/etc/services:
        pop-3    110/tcp

/etc/inetd.conf:
        pop-3  stream  tcp  nowait  root  /usr/local/etc/zpoplib/zpop  zpop

/usr/local/etc/zpop.config:
        trace /usr/tmp/zpop-trace
        debug ERRORS WARNINGS
        spool /var/mail
        ...

    * Send a HUP signal to the inetd daemon to start the
      POP-3 service.

        kill -HUP process-id

Port 110 should now be configured to run Z-POP as the default POP-3 service.


    <a name="IA2"><b>2. Why should I also set up Z-POP on tcp port 15232?</b></a>

Setting up Z-POP on port 15232 will as the service 'zpop' will exhibit no
functional difference from Z-POP installed as 'pop-3' on port 110.  However,
it will give the sysadmin a chance to differentiate between what kinds of
services are distribuited on each port, since Z-Mail clients request POP-3
specific functionality on one channel and can be configured to request Z-POP
functionality on another, separate channel.  This allows the sysadmin some
degree of freedom in assigning services to his users.


   <a name="IB"><b>B. Trouble Shooting</b></a>

    <a name="IB1"><b>1. What if the Z-POP server does not recognize my password?</b></a>

Passwords are case sensitive, and need to be used when connecting to Z-POP 
from Z-Mail.  If you have enabled 'shadow' passwords on your system, make 
sure that you are using the most recent build of Z-POP for that platform for 
compatibility.  i.e.- Enabling 'shadow' passwords on an IRIX 5.3 SGI Indy is 
not supported by the Z-POP for IRIX 4.x build.


    <a name="IB2"><b>2. What is a "pop_stat" error, and how do I get around it?</b></a>

To get around a pop_stat error, which occurs when Z-Mail for Windows and Z-POP
use synch to create a temporart maildrop that is so big it times out a serial
setting, we recommend bumping the value of the IOTimeoutSeconds (Serial
Read/Write Timeout (secs) in the Z-Mail for Windows Client Setup UI)
from 30 to 60 (or more) seconds.

    <a name="IB3"><b>3. What is a "pop_dropcopy" error?</b></a>

The Z-POP config file contains a number of directives that should be set by
your site's system administrator.  In the case of a pop_dropcopy ERROR the
SPOOL directive could be pointing to an incorrect location.  It is also
important to note that Z-POP should be setgid the same as the mail spool
directory:

% ls -ld /var/mail
drwxrwxr-x   3 root   mail           512 Sep 21 17:10 /var/mail/

% ls -l zpop
-rwxr-xr-x   1 root     bin        24081 Sep 21 16:51 zpop

% chgrp mail zpop
% chmod 2755 zpop
% ls -l zpop
-rwxr-sr-x   1 root    mail        24081 Sep 21 16:51 zpop

If Z-POP or Z-Mail complains: "Maildrop lock busy!  Is another session 
active?" then try moving the current /usr/spool/mail/.$username.pop to another 
location (this file can also be recovered by opening it as a mail folder) so 
that Z-POP can create a new one to work with.  When ZPOP is not active, 
there should only be a 0 (zero) legnth dropcopy in the spool folder. Check 
that you have the latest version of Z-POP, since some new revisions address 
this problem.

    <a name="IB4"><b>4. What is a "ZHB2" error?</b></a>

This results when a user is attempting to synchronize mail between Z-Mail and
an older version of Z-POP that does not support this feature.  To eliminate 
this grab the newest server off of ftp.ncd.com!


    <a name="IB5"><b>5. What is a "uidl" error?</b></a>

"UIDL" is a new POP3 command described in the RFC-1725 draft specification 
-- and currently not supported by Z-POP and Z-MAil clients.  Here's the 
information taken directly from the spec:

Simply put; some POP clients use UIDL to identify messages on the host, 
but Z-POP doesn't do the UIDL command, so if a POP client gives it the 
UIDL command, Z-POP will complain.

    <a name="IB6"><b>6. What does "mime_err_Header" mean?</b></a>

The headers of one of the messages in the spool folder contain what
Z-POP considers to be a syntax error or a violation of RFC 822.  Later
Z-POP patchlevels are more lenient about the headers they accept; you
should first make sure you have the latest patchlevel of the Z-POP server
for your platform.  If you still get this error, you can look in the
Z-POP trace file to see which message is at fault.

The offending message can then be isolated and ftp'd to the Z-Mail client
and opened as a mail folder.


<a name="II"><b>II. Advanced Issues</b></a>

   <a name="IIA"><b>A. What is Mailbox Synchronization?</b></a>

Z-Mail synch is a feature of the interaction that is possible between Z-Mail 
for Windows 4.0 and the Z-POP mail server.  A better explanation  than space 
allows for here is available from both:

	http://www.ncd.com/Z-Code/zproducts/wp-synchronization.html
	ftp://ftp.ncd.com/pub/z-code/supported/doc/windows/sync.doc


   <a name="IIB"><b>B. How do I set up remote prefs and config downloading?</b></a>

    The LIBRARY directive in the zpop.config file
    specifies the directory in which zpop looks for the
    configuration files it downloads to clients.  Within
    this directory are subdirectories for each product which
    uses Z-POP (currently only zmail).  Within each product
    directory are directories for platforms on which the
    product runs (e.g. Macintosh and PC).  The platform
    directories may contain subdirectories for different
    versions of the platform.

    Each level of the library directory hierarchy contains a
    file named .give, which lists the files and
    subdirectories at that level which are included in the
    library.  To be included in the library, files and
    subdirectories must be listed in the .give file of the
    directory containing them.  The .give file is a text
    file with a single file or directory name per line.

    When a client connects to zpop to download
    configuration files, it gives zpop its type, the
    platform it is running on, and its version number.
    zpop uses this information to find the appropriate
    "home" directory within the library for that client.
    The client can then download all files in its "home"
    directory, as well as library files in its parent
    library directories.

 [14865] Sent OK: "Password required for patrick."
 [14865] Received: "pass ????????"
 [14865] Sent OK: "patrick logged in"

The Z-POP TRANSACTION phase, where Z-POP determines what download
library it should look in for the client library files:

 [14865] Received: "ZMOI"
 [14865] Sent OK: "Tell me about vous."

 [14865] Sent: "."
 [14865] Received: "QUIT"
 [14865] Sent OK: "ZPOP exiting normally at Mon Oct 16 16:20:14 1995

    Since the configuration files are also stored on the
    clients themselves, zpop will only download them to
    the client if they are missing from the client or if
    they have been changed on the server by the system
    administrator.  zpop determines whether its version of
    a particular file is newer than the version on the
    client by comparing the client-rev and sequence numbers
    of the files.  The client-rev and sequence number are
    stored on the first line of each file in a special
    format.  Files with higher client revisions and sequence
    numbers are newer than files with lower client revisions
    and sequence numbers.  The client revision takes
    precedence over the sequence number, and is optional.
    For example, the file attach.types on the server might
    have a sequence number of 10:

        # -%- File-id:attach.types; Client-rev:3.0; Seq-num:10 -%-

    while a client might have a sequence number of 5:

        # -%- File-id:attach.types; Client-rev:3.0; Seq-num:5 -%-

    In this example, the version on the server is newer, and
    zpop will automatically replace attach.types on the
    client with attach.types from the server.

    To propagate a modified file on the zpop server host
    to all clients, increment the sequence number in that
    file by 1.  The file will then automatically be
    downloaded to all clients contacting the server.

    For a file to be correctly downloaded, it must reside in
    the appropriate library directory and be listed in that
    directory's .give file.

    NOTE: The sequence numbers of library files provided for
    each client are reset to 1 with each client release.
    However, library files from newer releases are always
    considered newer than library files of previous
    releases, so you should install the new library files
    and set their sequence numbers to one greater than those
    of your existing library files.


   <a name="IIC"><b>C. Is there any other documentation on POP-3?</b></a>

The latest POP-3 Request for Comments document is RFC1725, which can be 
found at:

	http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/information/rfc.html
	http://www.pmg.lcs.mit.edu/rfc.html
	http://ds.internic.net/ds/dspg1intdoc.html

Also, recent Z-POP whitepapers are also availble from: 

	http://www.ncd.com/Z-Code/zproducts/wpapers.html


   <a name="IID"><b>D. Where can I find out more about Z-POP?</b></a>

WWWeb searches constantly turn up new, private Z-Mail support pages, though
I recommend highly the comp.mail.zmail newsgroup for beginning and advanced
user community support.  

Also, the newsgroups comp.mail.mime and comp.mail.zmail are archived
at NCD and will be maintained as a public service to the electronic
messaging community.

	ftp://ftp.z-code.com/pub/usenet/comp.mail.mime
	ftp://ftp.z-code.com/pub/usenet/comp.mail.zmail

The first of these is a large collection of messages posted to
comp.mail.mime, it has well over six thousand articles dating
back as far as December of 1992, although there may still be some
gaps.

The second archive is a complete collection of messages posted to
comp.mail.zmail.  This archive is much smaller, since that group is
much younger, but it should contain every article posted to the group
since the day it was born.

New articles are merged into the existing archives daily.  Articles
are archived three ways in three directories:

    number/

        This directory holds every article in the archive.  Each
        article appears in its own sequentially-numbered file.  The
        entire directory looks like one huge MH-format mail folder.
        The oldest article is named "1", followed by "2", "3", and so
        on.

    month/

        This directory holds one small archive for each month and year
        of the newsgroup.  Each monthly archive is in its own
        subdirectory, named using a pattern of "yymm".  So all
        articles from January, 1995 would be found in the directory
        named "month/9501/".

        Within each month's subdirectory, each article appears in an
        individual file whose name is a number.  The numbers will not
        be strictly sequential though -- rather, they will match up
        with the same numbers used in the "number/" directory.  So if
        a grand total of six thousand articles had been archived by
        the end of one month, the next month's archive will start with
        an article named "6001".

        You can also download an entire month's worth of articles at
        once, as a tar archive.  Just add ".tar" to the end of any
        subdirectory name, such as "month/9501.tar", and get that as
        though it were a file.  The entire contents of that directory
        will be streamed to you as a single tar archive.  You can also
        use ".tar.Z" or ".tar.gz" to speed things up if you have
        decompression tools.

    subject/

        This directory is also split into subdirectories, each with
        its own small archive.  Here, articles are grouped by subject.
        The name of each subdirectory is the same as the subjects of
        all the articles in that directory.  Again, the individual
        articles are named using the same numbers found in the
        "number/" directory.

        For example, if article number/23 has the subject:

            MIME and Z-Mail

        And if number/27 was a followup, with the subject:

            Re: MIME and Z-Mail

        The archiver will clean off the "Re:", and those two articles
        will also be found as:

            subject/MIME and Z-Mail/23
            subject/MIME and Z-Mail/27

        Again, you can also download an entire subject's worth of
        articles at once, as a tar archive.  Just add ".tar",
        ".tar.Z", or ".tar.gz" to the end of any subdirectory name,
        and get that as though it were a file.  The entire contents of
        that directory will be streamed to you as a single tar
        archive.
