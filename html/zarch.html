<P>
Z-Mail is organized into two major sections, the ``core'' and the graphical
user interface (GUI).  The ``core'' is in turn organized around four major data
objects:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Folder (mailbox)
<LI> Message
<LI> Composition
<LI> Z-Script Interpreter
</UL>
<P>
Of these, folder, message, and compostion are implemented as true data objects
(C structures) whereas the interpreter is actually a collection of global
state.
<P>
The command-line interface on UNIX is little more than the interpreter
accepting commands directly from textual user input, so it is not necessary to
discuss it in an architectural context.
<P>
The ``core'' has some expectation that the GUI is organized around the concept
of a frame object, where each frame represents one window or dialog.  The
``core'' communicates with the GUI by sending messages (actually implemented as
API calls) either to individual frames or, more frequently, to all frames as a
broadcast.  With few exceptions, these messages instruct the GUI to re-examine
the ``core'' data structures shared by the two sections, and to update the GUI
view to incorporate any changes that have been made to those data structures.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="folders">Folders and Messages</A></H2>
<P>
A folder object serves 3 purposes:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Manage a cache correspondence between in-memory data and a persistent
mailbox on disk.
<LI> Act as a container for cached data about the collection of messages held
in the corresponding persistent folder.
<LI> Maintain mailbox-specific interpreter state, such as the last set of
messages the interpreter acted upon within that mailbox.
</OL>
<P>
For convenience, the folder object is also used on some platforms to cache
certain mailbox-specific GUI data, such as a precomputed array of message
summaries for the main window display.
<P>
The ``core'' is historically single-threaded, and maintains a concept of a
single current folder from among those that have been opened.
<P>
Message objects are always (with one notable GUI exception) referenced
indirectly via an array of pointers maintained by their folder
container.<A HREF="#note1">(1)</A>
Each message object represents cached data, including unsaved state changes
(read, deleted, etc.) about a particular message.  The cached data includes the
text contents of any message headers that have been referenced by the
interpreter (or by the GUI), a decoded/transliterated copy of that header text
if the display character set is different than that of a given header, the
starting and ending offsets of the message within the (flat-file) mailbox on
disk, and a linked list of attachment objects<A HREF="#note2">(2)</A> for any
attachments (MIME body parts) contained in the message.
<P>
Via the current folder, the ``core'' maintains a concept of a single current
message on which all interpreter commands act unless other messages are
specified.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="compose">Compositions</A></H2>
<P>
Each composition object represents the complete state of an active composition.
Initial values for this state (default behaviors, custom headers, etc.) are
copied from the global interpreter and thereafter become unique to each
composition (with very few exceptions, e.g. verbose sending or the addressbook
cache).  The set of operations possible on a composition is so rich that a
separable subset of the interpreter is used to manage it; this subset is
accessed through the compcmd family of Z-Script commands.  In UNIX command-line
mode, even the parser for composition commands is separate (although compcmd
can still be used).  Consequently the interaction between compositions and
global state is more complex than for any other object.
<P>
The composition object also maintains the correspondence between the cached
state of the composition and the external files that are used to exchange data
with third-party text editors.  Finally, the composition manages a linked list
of attachment objects representing any MIME body parts that the user has
requested (in addition to the basic ``message body'').  These are the same
attachment objects used by the message object; messages and compositions are
otherwise distinct.
<P>
When the user requests that the compostion be saved as a draft or sent, the
composition object handles packaging up the message body and all attachments in
MIME format, and sends the result either to the SMTP agent or into a folder (in
the case of a draft or a queued send).  This is entirely a ``core'' operation;
the GUI is involved only insofar as user confirmation of various actions is
required.
<P>
The relationships among folders, messages, compositions, and the global
``core'' state are summarized in <I>Figure 1</I>.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="zscript">Z-Script Interpreter</A></H2>
<P>
The interpreter consists of a relatively simple line-oriented text parser with
a few syntax rules, plus a set of tables that control rewriting the text and,
eventually, interpreting it as commands.  The tables are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Variables
<LI> ``Cmd''s (command abbreviations)
<LI> Functions (user-defined)
<LI> Built-in commands
</UL>
<P>
All of these tables can change dynamically at run time, but only the first
three are under user control.  Built-in commands are added, deleted, or
modified by the ``core'' or by the GUI to match UI-specific or
platform-specific constraints.
<P>
In a typical interpreter cycle, a line of text is read from the input.
Variable references are textually replaced according to the syntax rules.  The
word in the command position (in the simplest case, the first word on the line)
is then compared to the table of ``cmd'' abbreviations; if there is a match,
the text is again rewritten as specified by the abbreviation.  The (possibly
new) word in command position is then looked up in the table of functions; if a
matching function is found, the interpreter state is pushed onto a stack, the
input is changed to be the text of the function body, and the cycle repeats.
If no function matches, the word in command position is looked up in the table
of built-ins, and if a match is found, that built-in command is executed.
Finally, if no matching built-in is found, the interpreter sets the global
error status flag (which in some cases causes any remaining lines of input to
be discarded).
<P>
If there is more input to be consumed, the cycle begins again.  If the input is
exhausted at the end of a function body, the state stack is popped and reading
of the calling input is resumed.  Otherwise the interpreter returns control to
whatever C routine originally requested the Z-Script interpretation.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="filters">Filters</A></H3>
<P>
A filter represents an automatic invocation of the interpreter triggered by
opening a folder or by the arrival of new mail in a folder.  The table of
filter actions is maintained by the ``core'' but is otherwise incidental to the
architecture.  (To be really effective, filters should have been included in
the architecture, not bolted onto it.  There are cases where filters fail to
operate because they are interpreter entities rather than properly-integrated
components of mailbox management.)
<P>
Flow of control through the Z-Script interpreter, and its relationship to the
other core data structures, is shown in <I>Figure 2</I>.
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="zarch2.gif">
<P ALIGN="center"><I>Figure 2</I>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="aliases">Aliases and Headers</A></H3>
<P>
Two additional tables are maintained in the ``core'' for use by compositions.
These are the user-defined aliases (e-mail address shorthands) and customized
headers, also known as the message ``envelope.''
<P>
Customized headers are referenced once when a composition begins.  They are
copied into the composition at that time, and further modifications within a
given composition do not affect other compositions.  Similarly, modifications
to the global copies of the custom headers do not affect compositions in
progress.
<P>
Aliases, on the other hand, are maintained only in global state.  A given alias
may optionally be expanded automatically at the time it is used in addressing a
composition, in which case changing the global aliases will no longer affect
that expansion.  However, if the global state is changed, a second reference to
that same alias in the same composition expands to the new value from the
global state, not to the previous value seen in that composition.  If aliases
are not auto-expanded, they expand to the global state as it exists at time of
send.
<P>
The complete ``core'' section of the architecture is summarized in <I>Figure 3</I>.
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="zarch3.gif">
<P ALIGN="center"><I>Figure 3</I>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="gui">Graphical User Interface</A></H2>
<P>
The GUI represents a set of views onto ``core'' data
objects.<A HREF="#note3">(3)</A>  Each of these
views is in turn represented by a frame object.  The primary views correspond
to the three primary data objects in the ``core'':
<UL>
<LI> Main window - views a folder
<LI> Message display window - views a message
<LI> Compose window - views a composition
</UL>
<P>
The main window is also the primary view onto the Z-Script interpreter.
However, all the frames interact with the interpreter and global ``core'' state
at some level.  The three primary frames have configurable toolbars, buttons,
and menus, tied directly to the interpreter.
<P>
Each of the frames has a direct handle to the ``core'' object that it
views.<A HREF="#note4">(4)</A>
The frames are responsible for keeping the UI up to date with respect to
changes in the state of the underlying objects.  An original design goal was
that ``core'' objects would have as little knowledge of the UI as possible, so
the ``core'' objects do not directly notify their viewers of state changes.
Instead, the ``core'' uses a set of API calls to broadcast to all the frames
whenever any object's state changes.  Each type of frame is expected to
recognize broadcasts that apply to it, and to ignore the rest.  Very few of
these API calls are directed to specific frames.
<P>
The relationships of the primary GUI frames to ``core'' objects are shown in
<I>Figure 4</I>.
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="zarch4.gif">
<P ALIGN="center"><I>Figure 4</I>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="dialogs">GUI - Dialogs</A></H3>
<P>
In addition to the three primary frames, the GUI has several auxiliary frames
that handle specific data management tasks.  These include Search (by date or
by pattern), Variables, Aliases, Envelope (custom headers), and various File
Finder dialogs (for saving messages, opening or renaming folders, and managing
attachments).  Some of these, such as aliases and envelope, represent views
onto global ``core'' state.  Others, such as search, represent interpreter
actions and capture transient results of those actions for display.
<P>
Examples are shown in <I>Figure 5</I>.
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="zarch5.gif">
<P ALIGN="center"><I>Figure 5</I>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="state">Tracking ``Core'' State</A></H3>
<P>
The most significant state change in the ``core'' is a change of the current
folder.  This may happen because a new folder is opened, or it may happen
because the current folder is closed.<A HREF="#note5">(5)</A>  The main window tracks any change of
current folder, as do most other frames that deal with folders or messages,
including the compose window.  Frames that view other global state usually also
track these changes, but do not make use of the information.
<P>
The notable exception is the message window, which tracks the message that it
views and therefore tracks the folder containing that message.  If the folder
is closed, so that the message becomes unavailable, the message window
closes.<A HREF="#note6">(6)</A>
<P>
Each frame also maintains a message selection reflecting the messages most
recently accessed by that frame.  In the main window, this is the user
selection from the message summaries display; in the search dialogs, it is the
result of the most recent search operation; in the message window, it is the
message displayed.  Most frames, including the compose window but not the
message window, track the main window selection if it has changed more recently
than the frame's selection.  Frames that normally have no interaction with
folders or messages always use the main window selection (should they happen to
need one).
<P>
The message selection is maintained by number index into a folder object's
array of message pointers.  This means that a ``sort'' operation invalidates
the selected list of every frame that references the sorted folder.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="calling">Calling Z-Script</A></H3>
<P>
Recall that the interpreter always operates upon the current folder and single
current message in that folder, unless instructed otherwise.  When a GUI frame
makes a call to the interpreter, the folder and message selection associated
with that frame must be used instead.  The ``core'' passes a global opaque
handle to the calling frame through an API call to obtain that frame's message
selection.  This same handle<A HREF="#note7">(7)</A> is also passed back to the GUI in the event of
an error, so that error dialogs or other indicators can be associated with the
problem UI element.
<P>
The complete calling sequence from the GUI to the interpreter must therefore
include:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Set the global handle to the active UI element of the calling frame.
<LI> Save a handle to the global current folder.
<LI> Change the global current folder to the folder referenced by the calling frame.
<LI> Call the interpreter.
<LI> Restore the global current folder to its previous value.
<LI> Update the display to reflect any state changes.
</OL>
<P>
Step 5 must be special-cased when the operation in step 4 includes a request
for the ``core'' to open or close a folder.  There are both GUI-level and
interpreter-level wrapper functions to be sure these steps are followed in the
correct order, but historically there has been confusion about using the
wrappers or calling the lower-level interpreter functions directly.
