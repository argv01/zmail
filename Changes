-------------------------------------

Miscellaneous:
    POP3 support, variable pop_options to allow choice of leaving mail on
    the host.

    MIME support: conformance with Internet Draft, "MIME
    (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) Part One: Mechanisms for
    Specifying and Describing the Format of Internet Message Bodies",
    April 1993, a standard format for multimedia messages.

    Fully localizable international support

    filelist_fmt
    file_test
    hidden
    is_lite
    ispeller
    pop_options
    pop_timeout
    timeout
    use_pop                     Toggles POP3 support on and off.

Changed variables:
    record_users		May be set to "all" to create files.
    quiet			New field: blink, index
    verify			New fields: addresses,close,mkdir
    				Changed field: quit

New X Resources:
    *finderFullPaths		Boolean: show full path names in FileFinder
    *iconGeometry:		Geometry: placement and size of main icon
    *maxTextLength		Integer: limit of largest paged text (bytes)
    *scrollLength		Integer: main output scrollback size (bytes)

    Assorted others for new dialogs; old dialogs have had more strings made
    available in the resource file for localization purposes.

Licensing:
    Single-user mode: one copy of Z-Mail is allowed to run per workstation.

Aliases dialog:
    Uses interface similar to Compose window for address entry/editing.

Main window:
    See $hidden, and "New X Resources" above.  New 'Folder Popup' that
    replaces old Opened Folders dialog.

Compose window:
    'Expand' button under Addresses list expands aliases.

File Finder (all dialogs that have one):
    Full path display can be turned off (see *finderFullPaths resource).
    Format of file display can be changed (see filelist_fmt variable).
    Navigation can be limited to a subtree (see chroot command).

Help Index:
    New hypertext navigation feature, searching. Much of the help text
    has been reformatted and/or rewritten to take advantage of
    hypertext feature.

Message window:
    Limit size of displayed message (see *maxTextLength resource).

Paging dialog ("page" command):
    Limit size of displayed text (see *maxTextLength resource).
    Allowing editing and file operations in pager dialog.

    chroot		(Name may change to differentiate from UNIX chroot.)
    compcmd             Manipulates compositions in progress.
    disable, enable	Turn off (on) Z-Script commands from system.zmailrc.
    hide, unhide	(See $hidden and flags command)
    :h, :v		(See headers command)

Changed commands:
    alias		Syntax for including addresses from file.
    cd			Restricted by the chroot command
    edit		Works in GUI mode now.
    flags		Options -H to hide, -V to unhide.
    headers		Options -H:h and -H:v for hidden/visible summaries.
    mail		New "default" template (may change slightly).
			New -R option for return-receipt (new in 2.1.5).
			See "address_book" etc. variables.
    my_hdr		New syntax for dynamic headers (see command.hlp).
    quit		verify=quit now prompts separately from update.
    			See also "exit_hook".
    sort		New option -t (not in on-line help, partially works).
    trap		Signal names (HUP, INT, etc.) may be used.
    update		Automatically creates full path to $mbox.
    write		No longer sets S (saved) flag on messages.
    			Warns of loss of attachments.

Hook functions:
    startup_hook	Called at startup after loading first folder.
    exit_hook		Called at quit after closing last folder.
    fetch_mail_hook	Called every 15 minutes (period settable).
    receive_mail_hook	Called after fetch_mail_hook finishes.

    To use a hook function, simply create a user-defined function with
    that name.

Removed for Basic:
    Buttons and Functions dialog
    Z-Script commands in help index

Removed:
    Support for IXI's X.desktop drag and drop.
