This is release 7.2.4 of the Mail User's Shell (mush).

Mush was last posted as a complete package at release 7.2.2.  Before that,
the last complete posting was 7.1.1.  If your version of mush is older
than 7.2.2, refer to README-7.0 and README-7.1 for lists of other changes.
See README-7.2.0 for changes from 7.1.1 to 7.2.  Patch 3 was bugfixes only;
there was no README-7.2.3, so the list of bugfixes in that patch has been
appended.

Changes in compilation:

    Be sure to check out the README file for complete details of new info
    on compilation for SysVr2, SysVr4, Ultrix, Domain/OS, IRIX, and MIPS.
    There are new preprocessor definitions for SVR2, SVR4, and IRIX4, plus
    a set of patches and auxiliary files for Apollo.  There are also new
    instructions for compiling mush to read MMDF-style spool files while
    still using sendmail as the MTA (some "native" MH sites need this).

    If you have a csh with filec set and typing ahead at an exiting mush
    seems to send end-of-file to your shell, define CSH_FILEC_FIX.  It's
    completely ridiculous that mush has to deal with this so I refuse to
    mention it in README with the mush-configuration defines.

New/changed commands:

    There aren't any.

New/changed variables:

    pager
	If $pager has the value "NONE", mush will not run an external
	pager and will not pause for input at the end of each screenful
	of output.

Tool mode changes:

    None of these, either.

Miscellaneous:

    The config.h file has been reorganized a bit more.

    The "digestify" script has a clever perl-style startup conditional
    so you can #! it as a csh script if your path to mush is too long.

    The environment variable MAIL is now recognized at startup time to
    specify the location of the spool folder.

    When SVR2 and DOT_LOCK are defined at compile time, mush assumes that
    saved-set-group-id is not available.  The file lock.c can be compiled
    into a separate locking program to handle the setgid requirements.
    See extensive comments at the top of lock.c.

Bugs fixed in Patch #4:

  * A couple of long-standing array overflow and "underflow" bugs found
    and squished.

  * Interrupting the "bind" curses-mode command now works more like the
    other interruptible commands.

  * The "stty" command behaves itself.

  * Non-SYSV systems using DOT_LOCK won't get strange reports from the
    "save" command about messages saved to the lock file.  (That wasn't
    happening but the output was confusing.)

  * Using the "folder" curses-mode command will now remove empty folder
    files if the line-mode "folder" would do so.

  * SYSV systems should have no more complaints about EWOULDBLOCK not
    being defined in file.c.

  * The "folder" command won't print the folder status line if piping
    or otherwise told to shut up (e.g. "mush -N").

  * Attempting to reference a $[%x] header-formatted variable during
    initialization no longer causes a core dump.  You still can't do
    it, but at least mush refuses politely.

  * The "reply" family of commands do a better job with addresses whose
    real name or comment fields that contain double-quote characters.
    Specifically, they put such names in ( ) instead of in " ".

  * Over-long lines in init files and "source" files now generate an
    error message instead of truncating silently.

  * Systems using DOT_LOCK should no longer find dead lock files lying
    about.  The whole DOT_LOCK procedure has been made more robust so
    it can be used as a failsafe on systems with NFS-mounted spools.

  * Tty twiddling is no longer done in headers-only mode ("mush -H").

  * The little-used feature of referencing another variable from within
    the autosign and autosign2 variables actually works now.  I probably
    should just have removed it altogether.

  * Compiling with SUNTOOL defined no longer breaks the lock-failed case
    in folder updating for line mode.

  * The descriptive output from "pick" is now correct when using -x with
    a date search.

Bugs fixed in Patch #3:

  * The user's real name ($realname) is no longer left empty.

  * REGCMP users (mostly SysV) no longer get core dumps when using pick.

  * Attempts to send mail (e.g. via Fcc: headers) to the same file or
    folder more than once *silently* sends only one copy to the file.
    (Before, it complained about not being able to write to the file
    for the second and later attempts.)

  * SCO UNIX 3.2 users who are having problems with "submit" can now
    define M_EXECMAIL to use execmail as their interface to MMDF.  This
    has the pleasant side-effect of making the MTA invocation compatible
    with sendmail, so resetting the variable "sendmail" works cleanly.

  * Problems with file locking and lock.c typos for SCO UNIX have been
    corrected (we hope).

  * SCO UNIX correctly includes <sys/select.h> (we hope).

  * Attempts to load folders containing more than the defined maximum
    number of messages work a bit better.  You still can't load all the
    messages, but the results are less strange.

  * Some <curses.h> macro name clashes for unusual UNIXen have been
    forcibly suppressed.

  * An amazingly old string overflow bug in toolmode has been fixed.
